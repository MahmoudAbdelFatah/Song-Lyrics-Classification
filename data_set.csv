Casual,I Didn't Mean To,"Verse One:

Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about
I didn't mean to

Chorus: Repeat 2X

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Verse Two:

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should of done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge
Its a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin to front on me ya know
Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to

Chorus


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin
Actin like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and thats weak shit
Thats why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now shes not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to and I been through
Your relationship and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to

Adam Ant,Something Girls,"Adam Ant/Marco Pirroni
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
She's got something
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl has a somehing smile
Every girl is a something girl
For a while
If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls
Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something
When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight
Think of someone you can do
Relax and let that something through
Every girl is a something girl
She's got she's got something",happy,1
Gob,Face the Ashes,"I've just erased it's been a while, I've got a world for sale
And now I walk away from it, it's better done secret
I never mouthed those words away, I wouldn't cause concern
Die in a crossfire runaway none of this exists
Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in
I'm not the one I swear I'm not, no matter how I felt
Die in a crossfire runaway, face the ash again
Someone is killing me",sad,0
Lionel Richie,Tonight Will Be Alright,"Little darling 
Where you've been so long 
I've been out here thinking about ya 
And the feeling's real strong 
Well the time has come to celebrate 
You and me girl so sounds great 
Cause tonight will be alright 
Oh baby 

Little darling, come on 
Let's take a ride 
To a midnight honey town and set it on fire 
We don't want to be mad 
But we have to be cool 
You and me girl 
Let's break all the rules 
Cause tonight will be alright 
Oh my baby, I'm gonna say it again

Down the highway

Till our hearts desire 
Anything you wanna do girl

Keep me thinking about you honey

Blue Rodeo,Floating,"Lead Vocal by Greg

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste,
Like french cigarettes.
And these coloured drinks
that you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget.

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall.
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same.
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free.
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

That I daydream every day
I'm alive and well
Right now I'm alive, I'm feelin' well
It's my life to live my way

Who knows, maybe someday it will all come true
And I will get my way
And we will live as one

what cannot will be done
for every living thing under the sun

The Dillinger Escape Plan,Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants,"First off let me say you look so tired...
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky...
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight
So drop the gown the game's over just push your face into the fight and it breaks my heart like dancing up all night ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong like nothing we've ever...
Felt before

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby you can have it
Baby you can have it

Ooh baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...

Of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
The stranger's candy, broken alleys
Tonight we could bring it all down we could bring it all down

They think this body's a dead note dancing to the beat but they'll never see this corpse coming 'till it kills them",happy,1

Five Bolt Main,Made Like This (Live),"Conclusions, illusions, of mainstream intrusions
I'm saying this is just your life
Brain of the main-frame, life
Your single one and only life
I'm starting from the back again, it's never ending
Ran off the track yes once again, the vibe is sending
So far from where I might have been, this message pending
I won't stop looking back again, the road is bending
Time exists on a band 'round your wrist, and the people you trust should be last on your list


We could solve the world's problems with just one wish, we were made like this
Time exists on a band 'round your wrist, and the people you trust should be last on your list
We could solve the world's problems with just one wish, we were made like this

Willie Bobo,Spanish Grease,"Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?
In the city?

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

John Wesley,The Emperor Falls,"Brick by brick
stone by stone
dismantle the will of a man
strip his flesh and bone

Reach out your hand
the moment comes
blade catches the light of your eyes
the man slowly comes undone

Nobody noticed
no one saw a thing
all turned a blind eye to the fallen
and the bad luck he brings

You wake in the morning after
the sky's a color that you can't see
friends have fallen by the wayside
why isn't anyone talking to me
get those funny looks in the market
people you loved just stare
wander on with your hands in your pockets
even your girlfriend don't care

They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor

To watch the emperor fall

One part truth
three parts deceit
two parts shit that you made up
add passion for heat

Did ya hear he said this
can you believe he done that
can you believe the nerve of the man
let me at him tell me where he's at
wake to your fave in the mirror
see someone you don't recognize
stare at the changes in the reflection
you've become someone that you despise",sad,0
Billie Jo Spears,It Makes No Difference Now,"Makes no difference now what kind of life fate hands me
I'll get along without you now that's plain to see
I don't care what happens next 'cause I'll get by somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

It was just a year ago when I first met you
I learned to love you and I thought you loved me too
But now that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

Now that we have really parted I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
I know that something had to happen and it happened somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

After all is said and done I'll soon forget you
Although I know that it will be so hard to do
Let things happen as they will and I'll get by somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now",sad,0

No one's got the time to spare.
Money's tight, nothin' free,
Won't somebody come and rescue me?

Sell your soul just to buy, buy, buy.
Beggin' a dollar, stealin' a dime,
Come on can't you see that I
I am stranded ,caught in the crossfire
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire.

I need some kind of kindness, some kind of sympathy oh, no

Save the strong lose the weak,
Never turning the other cheek.
Trust nobody don't be no fool,

It's been so dull since you left Nashville
I've read the same books again & again
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
When it comes to other men

But if I could have my way
Darling you'd come home

Remember when you moved to Nashville
And the first time that we kissed
Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed

And when you make it back to Nashville
We'll forget all of your sins
And I still buy two pairs of everything
So when you come home you & I'll be twins

Saying things, saying things that
I got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye

I feel unusual from thinking
About the underground decay, God help me
Kill beneath the camera, watch the world begin to cry
It's not from pity
It comes from what's been sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in
Got something sticking in
Got something sticking in my eye",happy,1

Is sure to fail
I could crawl around the floor

Like you

I want to be 
You
I should learn to be man
Like you

Plug me in
And turn me on
Oh everything is moving here

I need my treatment
It's tomorrow they send me
Singing ""I am an American""
Do you?

Picture this
If I should make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall!

And who are you?
And how can I try?
Here inside I like the metal

Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,She Fell Away (2009 Digital Remaster),"Once she lay open like a road
Carbed apart the madness that I stumbled from
But she fell away
She fell away
Shed me like a skin
She fell away
Left me holding everything 

Once the road lay open like a girl
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
But she fell away
She fell away
I did not see the cracks form
As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no 

Sometimes
At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand
For she fell away
O she fell away
Walked me th the brink
The fell away
I did not see her fall
To better days
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all
She fell away
She fell away
She fell away",sad,0

Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul
A wound unhealing

But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high

Organized Konfusion,Hate,"Pharoahe Monche:

Recognize me nigga, look into my eyes
See raw visualizations of hate reincarnated
In it's most unadulturated form I breeth evil incarnate
Only for the purpose to mislead, what was once promising seeds 
Are now destroyed and misplaced with mischievious weeds for greed
The purpose, inseminate the bitches
Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches
Nigga political snitches, Abe me which is
The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious
Yea
Take these keys, that for years were not found
Allowing all Simeons to be freed thats locked down
It returns way back to the block
Only to cop more Smack, Rock from cops that act
not in a manner for you to prosper
You are Ab-so-lete unless
You can handle the ball during a full-court press
When the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion
known to mankind HATE!
Awww, you are sadly mistaken if you think my Aryan race
can be taken out by the likes of you Apes, Kikes
conservative nigga loving Gooks, Spooks, and Dykes
My Spikes, bald headed white laces
Braces the fact that I'm prepared for vicious acts of war

Regain job positions, remain in control of opposition
Placed here to be the scum of the earth, serving us hand and foot

Never to overlook the main crook who disperse shook
Versions of the bible, Sabotaging shit since Christophers arrival

Making them Indian pay for survival
Now life for Ricans and Coons is homicidal
We Neo-Nazis seek nothing but world domination
God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation

Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations
So my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood
Sickle cells decreasing your death rate, you black bitch
But I like the way you suck my wood

Saafir,Crawl Before You Ball (Album Version),"Intro:
Yo Saafir what's goin' on playboy?
Saafir: What's really goin' on?

Huh, you tell me baby.

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man.
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man.

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately.

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they
ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook: (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin'
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
>From the trenches
The stench is unknown
I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes
Recognize
I'm crawlin'

Bridge: (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green

The Verve Pipe,Medicate Myself,"I hear you cryin' for me 
But I see the anger in your eyes
I want what will not judge me
I need what keeps me warm inside

A man without a purpose
Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer
Disease as you proclaim
And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Held prisoner by a monkey
Strapped on behind my back
And while I sit ablaze 
The light is slowly fading into the black
So I

I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again

Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
One more drink and I will be drowned

I know you hate to see me
As I defeat myself this way
You know you can't control me
You know I'm slipping day by day

Down into my obsession
Down in the hole where I belong
And when this fight is over
You will stay right here and I will be gone
So I

I've got to medicate myself again    3x

I found you broken 
And lying on the floor
An empty bottle in the drain
I put my hand right through the kitchen door

I've got to medicate myself again
Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
I barely get my coat off and you're already
Crawling down my back again
Yeah you get to watch me sinking down
One more drink and I will be drowned

I've got to medicate myself again",sad,0

To keep me satisfied

Dolly Parton,Letter To Heaven,"An old man was sitting at his table one day 
Writing a letter to pass time away 
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee 
Saying won't you please write a letter for me 
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away 
I coming to see her real soon I hope 
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat 

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope 
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail 
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale 

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way 
A big auto hit her and sped away fast 
The little girls prayers had been answered at last 

The postman was passing and picked up the note 
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke 
Straight up into heaven this letter did go 
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",sad,0

I know this one thing well

I used to try to kill love, was the highest sin
Breathing insecurity out and in
Searching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight
Pursuing the greater way for all human light

How I choose to feel is how I am
How I choose to feel is how I am
I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today

Holding on, the light of night
On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul
Again

Let me run into the rain

But don't you look too close, cause you just might see the person

That you hate the most, Lord, what's happening to this human race

I can't even see one friendly face, brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes

While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies, take a look at your children 

Born innocent, every boy and every girl, denying themselves a real chance

To build a better world, oh!   Dear Lord what's happening to your precious dream

I think its washing away on a bloody, bloody stream, yes, take a look at your children 

Before it's too late, and tell them nobody, nobody wins when the prize is hate

Oh, no, no, no It's not too late, we gotta tell all of our children

A lotta people already know excatly where it's at

(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin nothin but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see 
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively 
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win 
Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n 
Kick it

Cradle Of Filth,Summer Dying Fast,"Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

I'd be skating
Skating on thin ice if I don't agree(-e-e-eee)

And you killed it with I love you, with I love you

Only three little words that I seem to be so scared of
I'm so scared of
So please show me
How to get these words off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind.
I know that you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
But if I say it back to you

Oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh oh-oh

It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind.""

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

Around a black ball-point pen
These eyes don't wander as far
As they at one time did
I've seen the future, it's fading faster

No place that I'd rather be
Than right here, right now
There's no time that I'd rather be
Than right here, right now

I'm on the other end begging you
Pick up the phone
A shaking whisper is answering
Don't call anymore
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening

Freeze me in this moment
Thaw me in ten years
When the fires burned out and the smoke clears

And you will find me alone again

And get to the top of a mountain pinnacle

Silent promotion you're feeling within yourself
Just like the ocean, you're crashing against the well
All of the time, you're forgetting about yourself
Looking back after the facts
What have you left yourself?

Talk some shit and I'ma hit you with this quick block
Body parts are scattered and sealed up in ziplocks
With my steel cats get ill'd up to six blocks
You can try to run away but you won't get far
They call me Prozak, BITCH!, the knight of Templar
I'll open up your brain like the Deathstar
And lyrics come to me like ghosts from the graveyard

Since my birth I've been obsessed with the dead
Homocidal thoughts while I was bein' breast fed
I tried to kill myself but I survived instead
From pieces of a broken mirror, sliced my wrists, bled

Shit, my wicked rhymes will have you overdose
I'll leave your ass comatose
You try to play me close I'll levitate the smoke
When I hit the fuckin' stage be like, ""What's that smell?""

The radios afraid to play my wicked paragraphs
Go to the station lock and load up on they whole staff
And let them know the danger of us crossin' paths
And let it be known that I spit the truth like a polygraph

There's always room for another carbon copycat
They tried to run with my style but I got it back

Sandi Thom,Wounded Hearts,"Just before I tell you standing in the rain 
I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my babys been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still dont know if Im a wounded heart.

Ive seen a lot of heartache and Ive walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasnt crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling Ill be gone
 
Oh my babys been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still dont know if Im a wounded heart
No I still dont know if I'm a wounded heart.

So many fools fall in love
And its a crying game
Its a crying shame
That Im not a fool in love
But I know what Im feeling 
And my heart is still healing

Oh my babys been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still dont know if Im a wounded heart
No I still dont know if I'm a wounded heart.",happy,1
Gene Clark,Set You Free This Time,"Clark

The first thing that I heard you say 
When you were standing there 
Set in your way was that you were not blind 
You were sure to make a fool of me 
Cause there was nothing there 
That you could see 
That could go beyond your mind 
Now who's standing at the door 
Remembering the days before 
And asking please be kind 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I've set you free this time 

I have never been so far out in front 
That I could ever ask for what I want 
And have it any time 
Knowing this you found a thought for me 
That told you just what I should be 
And there I stood behind 
With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to 
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be 
I've set you free this time 

I could never find a chance to choose 
Between a way to win or a thing to lose 
Because there was your stand 
On top of all the love you took 
There was only something 
You can look at lying in your hand 
Now who's wondering what has changed 
And why it can not be arranged 
To have each thing work fine 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I'll set you free this time",sad,0
The Shirelles,Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"Tonight you're mine completely
You give you love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?",happy,1
Panic At The Disco,Northern Downpour (Album Version),"If all our life is but a dream
Fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me

And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along 
In storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes, and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down

Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page
It's chasin' off the days
Look back at boat feet 
And that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me

Through playful lips made of yarn 
That fragile Capricorn 
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down

Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weather vanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weather vanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy mornin'

Jan Howard,Bad Seed,"Ain't been in Little Rock but two weeks and here I am now
Packing up and disappearing into thin air
Guys in Little Rock are cute but I can't make my heart take root
Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere
I need lots of sunshine I need lots of raindrops I need to breathe the open air
I hope to beg your pardon your town just ain't my garden
Bad seed won't grow just anywhere
So honey kiss goodbye to your bad seed my love is not the kinda love you need
I could stay here with you but I wouldn't play fair
Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere
And you're looking at the baddest of the bad seed

Next stop Jacksonville now I don't know but I got the feeling
I might just kinda like it somewhere round there
Hear tell there's fertile land white pearly silver sands
And bad seed won't grow just anywhere
I need lots of sunshine...",happy,1
Sticky Fingaz,Oh My God,"(Sticky Talking)
C'mon man - oh my fucking God man..
Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck..

(Sticky)
Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

(God)
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware

(Sticky)
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me

(God)
It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

(Sticky)
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane

(God)
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same

(Sticky)
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

(God)
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using

(Sticky)
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

(Sticky)
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?

(God)
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity

(Sticky)
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain

(God)
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

(Sticky)
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?

(God)
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest

(Sticky)
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?

(God)
The process of all life
is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self

(Sticky)
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

(God)
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God",sad,0

Shawn Colvin,Another Long One,"If losing sleep were any indication
Of the loving that I've missed
I would wrap myself around you

And if life were not unfortunate
And reason blew like summer through the trees
I would stop to let you catch me
But I think that you would find me on my knees


And it's gonna be another long one tonight
It's just me and my well-intentioned spite
I said someone did this to me
But no one did, there's no injustices
I just can't afford to be right no more
I bought myself another bad dream tonight
With these little boys in my head sleeping tight
It's gonna be another long one tonight


There is comfort in a memory
And in roses just before you cut them down
There is danger in most everything
That's all the better when it's not around
And the last time I had the sense to notice 
You were right here being kind
But if I think that you are with me
Then I know that you can always change your mind


And it's gonna be another long one tonight
It's just me and my well-intentioned spite
I said someone did this to me

And we gotta leave by night
Before that river takes us down
We gotta find somewhere that's dry
We gotta run like we've never run,
Or we're gonna lose the light.
If we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more

Well, I fool myself and I don't know why
I thought we could ride this out
I was up all night making up my mind
But now I got my doubts
I got my eye on the waterline
Trying to keep my sense of humor
But if we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more

We gotta get to a higher place
And I hope we all arrive together
We gotta get to a higher place
If we wanna survive the weather

I remember walking with her in town,
Her hair was in the wind
I gave her my best kiss
She gave it back again
When I add up what I've left behind
I don't want to lose no more
But if we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more",sad,0

Lupe Fiasco,Streets On Fire (Explicit Album Version),"(Intro - Matthew Santos)
Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight",sad,0

In a pedestrian paradise
Where the catwalk got its claws (meow)
A subculture in a kaleidoscope of fashion
Prowl the streets of Harajuku (Harajuku, irasshaimase)

Super lovers, tell me where you got yours (at the super lovers store)
Yoji Yamamoto, I'm hanging with the locals
Where the catwalk got its claws, all you fashion know-it-alls
With your underground malls in the world of Harajuku
Putting on a show when you dress up in your clothes
Wild hair color and cell phones your accessories are dead-on

Harajuku girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan

I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan

Harajuku girls, I'm looking at you, girls
You're so original, girls, you got the look that makes you stand out
Harajuku girls, I'm looking at you, girls
You mix and match it, girls, you dress so fly and just parade around (arigato)

I'm fascinated by the Japanese fashion scene
Just an American girl, in the Tokyo streets
My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt
They're hard to find in the states, got me feeling couture (it's really cool)
What's that you got on? Is it Comme des Garons?
Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong, mixed up with second-hand clothes

You're looking so distinctive like DNA
Like nothing I've ever seen in the USA
Your underground culture, visual grammar
The language of your clothing is something to encounter
A Ping-Pong match between Eastern and Western
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection?
Just wait 'til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B.
'Cause it's (super kawaii), that means (super cute in Japanese)
The streets of Harajuku are your catwalk

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride

All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied

Be our best mistake
So let's take the time
To wipe the blood away

Natural Elements,Mayday,"[Verse 1: A-Butta]

Whoever is on the front line is gettin' struck first
We mercinaries, fuck turf
Every verse is varied, I bust first
Mayday, Natural Elements controllin' the ship
Rollin' a spliff that'll probably put my soul in a twist
But I remain bonin' a bitch
Got her buck-naked posin' for flicks
Actin' like she was never known for the shit
But I look over the shoulder and see the enemy lookin'
Physically strong but mentally shooken
And for penetentiary bookin's this shit happens
Get orders from my nigga Charlemagne the ship Captain
You sound like a bitch yappin' 
This shit is all Natural to us
Like blowin' endo out the window in the back of the bus
I move back and I bust
Rapid fire
You actin' flyer
Now your family's in black attire
With mad desire
When we caught you in the line of duty
You had it in your mind to shoot me
But every soldier of my kind sollutes me
Now I'm reclinin' with a Lucy
All of my niggas
Smoke it down to the filter
Holdin' a frown with a picture
You smell the smoke when I walk past
You saw blasts
You should've known about the drama in my warpath.

[Chorus]
Mayday Mayday, raise the white flags, time for the payday,
Payday, and it's like that, out shit is World Wide, North, South, East,
And West, put on your shield, lets see who's the best. Repeat 1x

[Verse 2: Mr. Voo-Doo]

You feel the burnin' emission
You squirm in submission
No terms and conditions
Ya'll confirm my suspicions
That ya'll are bitches that resemble Men
Like female Tennis players at Wimbledon
Why you tremblin'?
Shook like the ricter
My voice raise waves
And make ya'll change ways like crooks turnin Muslim
Blast shots burnin' your Bosom
Like bitch cramps
You got lucky your people told you switch camps
Or get damp with plenty led
I'm like a beast with many heads
Sort of like the Predators dreads
I got more arms than Dr. Octavious
Rock your whole block radius
I be the bomb
And I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm
The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?
Wet more domes than John the baptist
When the gat spits
It ain't over 'till the last man's limbs
Are twisted like he was doin Yoga
In fact my Pistol's longer than the Jokers
I ignite Mag's
Leave your toe wearin' a white tag
So, ya'll niggas better raise the white flag.

[Verse 3: L-Swift]

I swear theres a war in the air in the New York streets
You talk beef?
You had a swollen Melon, now you humble
With loaded weapons, nowhere to run to
We mega high, jet in the sky, droppin' bombs, 
Prepare to crumble as we rock on, 
Beware of the jungle with Anaconda's
Don't puff too much 'cause the enemy smells the Marijuana
We blastin' every object in Combat with honor
So yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action
No retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'
We blastin' heat 'till each member turns into has-beens
Soldiers bangin', who's click'll get done?
My crew can taste victory at the tip of the tongue
Always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun
And put it in, 'cause when it's on how many niggas'll run?
You said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest
You pullin' for breath, I'm claimin' your death
You shouldn't've stepped, war paint on my chest
Fatigue green and black
And the heat reacts
To make you bleed like hemophiliacs
See me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively
Releasin' caps 'till the enemy's gone, definitely
My people pack metal for me, let a legend be born
I declare war, (What mothafucka!) and it's on.

A Static Lullaby,Rattlesnake!,"God damn, holy diver. You made it right back to my bed. Manifested lips that whisper kiss.
That whisper kiss. Hey, hey ,hey. Pull the shades. I'm gutted. Guilty, played. And lonely.
I admit you wont see me again. My end is desperately engaged. Dark, departed, hollow.
You see I'm just a shadow. This ravenous beast is chasing shame. A shadow he remains.
How will my voice carry tonight? How do i look under these lights? Shove my head into the grand ivory keys.
Maybe this will teach me how to sing. Fuck hope, I'm a terror. Heavyweight human disaster.
I think I found Love. but what's love? When we cant be loved? Burn, burn, burn it down.
Icarus just hit the ground. To the youth that thought they could fly. I bottled up just drank up and died.
Palest white. I'm blues and reds. This patriot is long past dead. Forever ending. Remain but still gone.
Oh god I fear the steel. Oh how I fear the steel. Burn. My end is desperately engaged.",sad,0
Nights Like These,Ghost Town Rituals (Album Version),"And when I open my eyes I see the end of
An ending life I've forgotten how to live.
I keep forgetting, I keep rebuilding.
This is when I say I'm done.
I haven't learned.
No one will show me, so I go on my own.
Honestly, I'm so fucking pitiful.
Don't tell me what I've heard before.
Destined to walk another day alone.
This day is dying.
This day is fucking dead.
Just shine my way back home.
You can stay if you find comfort.
Don't speak.
Just breathe instead.
Just don't leave me alone.
I don't just need it, I deserve it.
I want what I promised myself.
I want what you promised us all.
I'm coming to terms.
This is the end of denial.
Sometimes things just fall apart.
Angels laugh above me and demons wait below.
I'm naked, bare, and broken, ready to go home.
Now I need you more than ever.
And when heaven overlooks me I'll need you there to pick me back up",sad,0

And you'll make me happy the rest of the days
Put your arms around me then I'll be your slave
Cause just a little lovin' will go a long way

Ever since that time began love has ruled the world
Even Adam set the pace and started in a whirl
I met you and now I know that you're the one for me
Come on back and you will plainly see

Just a little lovin'...

The trouble we could get into
Just fake it for me
Disregard the footsteps
And we'll never tell a soul

Tonight I'm finding a way
To make the things that you say
Just a little less obvious

I walk a fine line
Between the right and the real
They watch me closely
But talk is cheap here
Like a weightless currency
Your words don't mean shit to me
I'm always cashing out

The trouble we could get into
Just fake it for me
Disregard the footsteps

She's been shaking it since she was sixteen
Skips across the tables acting out her passion play

You take a gamble, got shot for romance

Chains, chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around

Chain of love that turns your world around

Without a warning Jeannie took off one night
Jack got so mean boy, he just had to fight
He died on the floor someone else evens the score
Back on the tables Jeannie's romance had died
That one look of love that told her a lie
And for her there's no waves crashing on seashores

Rise Against,Everchanging,"In the face of change

""I'm not sure anymore...""

And now, amidst the waves and the cloudless skies
That'd blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something 
That you thought would never end
And then of course it did?
Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin
And then something had to give?

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
There's always something in this everchanging life
And there probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

And now something 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me 
If i'm already gone

Well now something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now let's say that something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now that we
Make the same mistakes, we're always hanging on
Break those promises we're always leaning on
All this time spent waking up
I keep this line open to get this call from you 
Speak the words
That keep me coming back to you
Now this time it's all different

Now something has kept me here too long 
And now I'm gone...",sad,0

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay,
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?

There's a light we can love on the way

And freedom for those who obey

And all those who seek it shall find it
A pardon for all who believe
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind

To all who've been born in the Spirit
And who share incarnation with Him
Who belong to eternity stranded in time
And weary of struggling with sin

Forget not the hope that's before you
And never stop counting the cost
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost

Cause you see, I see right through you

Like the secrets of your rival
That paints them like a fool

You look just like a million dollars
But I think that you're nearly almost spent
And you're dying on the inside
You're lying on the inside
But don't fall apart
We can start again

Walls and cannonballs
Make unlikely friends
It seems they're destined to keep the other out
Or knock the other down
All they'd have to do is nothing
But maybe sleep a little late
And agree to let the other be
To twist their likely fate

You're lying on the inside

Mary Black,Turning Away,"Chorus

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On water we have walked like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

Chorus

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

Chorus

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away
Only the children of our children
Know the price they had to pay

Owl City,Panda Bear,"I'm moving to Tokyo
'Cause I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos could reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stayed
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale",happy,1

Your beauty and the gentle magic of your soul live here in my memory

Sounds of the river telling ancient tales

Fire flows in deep blue

Oh Nubia Nubia Nubia, the ringing in my ear
As I wander through another life in search of someone soft and sweet I once held near
Time glances the other way,
Lifes sweet shadow makes night his day
Brings me closer to you,
Paints my heart a deep blue

Whispers of eternity
Bridges lifes sweet mystery
To sleep I go and hear the name
Nubia Nubia Nubia Nubia...

Soft heart wait another day,
Flaming boat will take you away
Then at the mysterys end,
I wont have to pretend, 'tend, 'tend

I don't know if I can make it.
I don't know if I'm that strong.
I don't know where we went wrong but somehow it's over.
In my mind I see you clearly.
In my dreams I feel you near me.
I want to know, does this feeling go away? 

Like shooting stars we shine and then we fade,
breaking the promises we made.
What about the promises?
What about the promises we made?
What about our plans for forever?
Did they scare you?
Did you need to get away? 

You taught me many things.
Like how it feels to miss someone so bad it feels like a part of you is missing.
I can tell you one thing.
Now that you have gone I never will forget you.
You left your mark. 

I don't know if I can make it.
I don't know if I'm that strong.
I don't know where we went wrong but somehow it's over.
In my mind I see you clearly.
In my dreams I feel you near me.
I want to know, does this feeling go away? 

When I have gone and you've moved on will you remember me?
When I have gone and you've moved on will you remember me?

Like shooting stars we shine and then we fade,
breaking the promises we made.
What about the promises?
What about the promises we made?
What about our plans for forever?
Did they scare you?
Did you need to get away?",sad,0
Robben Ford,Something For The Pain,"Time to search my soul
Now that I'm alone
And I need you

Lessons from the past
Say nothin' ever lasts
But I need you

This I know for sure
They'll never be a cure
So, give me somethin' for the pain
So, give me somethin' for the pain

Taking my world apart
It's written in my heart
That I need you

You'd been runnin' through my veins
Before I knew your name
And I need you

One thing I know for sure
They'll never be a cure
After findin' her love so pure
So, give me somethin' for the pain, yeah
Give me somethin' for the pain

One day I'll be a different me
And fly out an open door
Then I will be that day set free
And dream of you no more
Dream of you no more

One thing I know for sure
They'll never be a cure
After findin' her love so pure
So, give me somethin' for the pain
Give me somethin' for the pain

Anti-Flag,This Is NOT a Crass Song,"You're walking down the street in the middle of the day
The sun is shinning brightly everything is quite OK
But then you hear this song, it makes you stop and yell out, HEY!
You might think that it is...

BUT THIS IS NOT A CRASS SONG!

You might think that it is but I'm telling you it ain't!
Although I will admit it sounds like something they might write
It's a happy little ditty makes you stomp and move your feet
You might think that this is...

BUT THIS IS NOT A CRASS SONG!

Masterpieces don't usually get written in a minute
But this one took just seconds or even less time to pen it
But don't be too amazed 'cause it's just got one verse and chantin'
You might think that this is...

Ahh...right..it's not a crass song is it?

The guitar rift is real savage and it ain't all that on time
The vocals are so Cockney that they may just blow your mind
And it's got made up words like, icklee, zicklee, vin, and plime
You might think that it is...

BUT THIS IS NOT A CRASS SONG!

We like to play it in the morning like to play it in the night
Do yourself a favor matey, sing it instead of starting fights
After only just one verse I'm telling you you'll feel all right
You might think that it is...

BUT THIS IS NOT A CRASS SONG!

Play it when you're walking, walking down the street
Play it when you're riding on your bike or on your feet
Doesn't really matter ' cause it's really really neat
You might think that it is...

Ahhh...

Sing it to your mommy, sing it to your dad
Sing it to your new girl friend or the one that you just had...

Uh, I love the Teletubbies, uh Teletubbies my favorite show,
Hello? Anybody there? Right...",happy,1
Rickie Lee Jones,Skeletons (Live Acoustic Version),"She was pregnant in May
Now they're on their way
Dashing thru the snow
To St. John's, here we go

Well, it could be a boy
But it's okay if he's girl
Oh, these things that grow out of
The things that we give

We should move to the west side
They still believe in things
That give a kid half a chance

When he pulled off the road
Step in a waltz of ted moon-beams
Said he fit an APB,
A robbery nearby

And he go for his wallet
And they thought he was going for a gun
And the cops blew Bird away

Some kids like watching Saturday cartoons
Some girls listen to records all day in their rooms
But what do birds leave behind, of the wings that they came with
If a son's in a tree building model planes?

Shelby Lynne,Old Times Sake,"Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.",sad,0

Climb to her fingernail and leap

And let the jet stream set you down

Are you gonna die in a raging fire ball?

She sees a fighter pilots mission and she wonders why

Caught up in the doom prepare for Satan

Heavily sedated wonder will I make it to the pearly gates
Or will I burn off in that lake now,
Could you feel the earthquake shaking the dead awake

Niggas had a lack of faith so life ain't straight, if you incapable,
Having a little trouble a day wid ah fiend or somethin'

The cars outside look like they've got the blues
The moon don't know if it's day or night
Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes
You're making coffee for everyone concerned
Someone points to this and someone points to that
Everyone is saying that you should lie down
But you ain't having none of that
And I say to the sleepy summer rain
With a complete absence of pain
You might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Hide your eyes, hide your tears,
Hide your face, my love
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain
And you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you",sad,0

I can feel my eyes burn
Looking down, the ground beneath is falling fast
Shedding the cares of this world

Now all the saints are dancing with the demons tonight
Welcome me home

Warren Barfield,Shadow,"I know my shady little shadow 
Would've left me long ago 
If he wasn't tied to my feet 
He's always been a scared one 
Turn off the lights and he runs 
Nowhere to be seen 

I am lonely only when I'm alone 

I need more than a shadow 
Someone that won't go 
Whenever life grows dark 
You're the only one I know 
Whose love never lets go 
We'll never be apart 
Never be apart 

You and me, we've got a good thing 
We move so smoothly 
You lead and I will follow 
You're closer than a brother 
I'm a book, You're the cover 
You surround my soul 

With You only my lonely is gone 

You're so much more than a shadow 
Someone that won't go 
Whenever life grows dark 
You're the only one I know 
Whose love never lets go 
We'll never be apart 

Never be apart

Dilated Peoples,Big Business,"(Rakaa Iriscience)
no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line...
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

In silence veiled, her withered cheek
A childhood queen without a throne
My dreamless sleeping child
Red sorrows grinning through my veins
My voice unheard, unseen the tears
Im waiting where the moonsun reigns
My garden whispers tunes
Hear my voice and drink my tears
I await you with firetunes
Veiled in everlasting silence
But once your heart was full of tunes
As we danced as one with the dryads of July
Ashra
Autumnal storms of endless grey
The harvester will sorrow reap
You saw the spring, the spring in May

Pickin' every single little lick I could
Just to please the man

Hangin' on through the heavy times
And hopin' for the best

And I can't recall the names of all
Them places that we played in
All them squirrely party girls
And pills we used to pop
Hardly ever sleepin' in
Those cheap motels we stayed in
Hopin' we could take it 'til we'd make it to the top

And them nights, get a little bit brighter
And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter
But them blues, well it's still the same old song

Every stranger knows our name
And every little where we go
Findin' out the bottom ain't so different
>From the top
Just a few more friends that you'll be losin'
When you drop

And I've left some of my soul on
Every sweaty sheet that I could sleep on
Gettin' just as close to any body as I could
I don't regret a single bed I've laid my body down on
Ever since the first I had
The worst I had was good

And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter

Artificially sweet

I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul

But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

I get smothered in dispair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more

I don't know what to do

So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul

And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely.

Ensiferum,Hero In A Dream,"A witch read from the palm of his hand
that his life would turn into darkness
and alone he would face all demons
from his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
that lie in the valleys of north and
his only change was to find his shadow
so he had to set forth

He is the man who travels in the land
of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
and he rules the forest of elves

Slash of the golden sword
a flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time

Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie

The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn

On the way to the ancient castle of time
he will soon be damned by rage
so that his pride could betray him
when it's time to set him free
The tears in his mind had to be pushed aside
as he walked through the gates
He will never die
'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream",happy,1

Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world",sad,0

All right
Gonna be all right
Do do
One more

There was a boy who lay awake at night
Dreamin' what he would do with his life
What would it take to pay the rent in for that sunny day
That sunny day

I can't tell you what to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
You can make it if you try
All I wanna say tonight is

""Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free""


All right
Gonna be all right
Do do...

Now that little boy is all grown up
So you see that the little boy was me
And I came here to let you know
That I found that sunny day
That sunny day

I can't tell you what to do
The dreams you hold will get you through
The power you need comes from within
Really know it's in your hands



Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free

I heard time and time again
How everybody's got a dream but they feel they won't win
'Cause somebody who was willin', who wanted to be chillin'
So they could never make it even if they were willin'
So we threw together this old school flow
So everybody in my generation oughta know
No matter what we take from this scene
Now you and me can follow our dreams

I can't tell you what to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
You can make it if you try


All right
Gonna be all right
Anything you want you can achieve
Gonna be all right
Breakin' down these walls you will be free


(All right, all right)
Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
(All right, all right)
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free


(All right, all right)
Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve

Time to begin, fly like the wind

I believe letting you go

Alone and confused

Knowing alone is alone
It's just too difficult to be just me instead of we

Not afraid to paint my sky with
Some who say I've lost my mind
Brother try and hope to find

You were always so far away
I know that pain so don't you run away
Like you used to do

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

You were always so far away
I know that pain
So I won't run away like I used to do

Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste

You were always so far away
I know the way so don't you run away

Heavens rejoice and the earth will exalt 
Oh no, come swing back like a catapult 
The sea and its fullness will roar 
He is our help and our shield our soul yearns for the lord 
Burning God of Yaacov everlasting stronghold 
Break down the door I can't hold back no more 
Wait all night long, until the early morning 
Like night watchmen wait for the dawning 

Chorus 

Arise, be our help 
Place my trust in your kindness 
It's a must hoping in the God of deliverance 
Since way back when before time began 
Existing eternally, everlasting, rejoice in the name of his majesty so we sing 

Chorus 

Chant sweet melodies, utter hymns and sing praise to his name 
For he's alone exalted holy, 
Performing mighty deeds and making new things, 
Sowing righteousness and creating healing 
He spoke, the world came into being 
Master of praise, renews each day 
Redeems and saves, continuously, blessed is his name 
Making great lights, creating luminaries 
Abounding in mercy 
Won't you grant me? 
Understanding 
To perceive, all the teachings in your Torah of love, existing eternally, lead me",happy,1

Kenny Price,Biloxi,"I just pulled out of Minneapolis and I aimed my headlights south
Got the taste of cherry lipstick still a clinging to my mouth
She begged me not to leave her and she cried till I nearly stayed
But I glanced at that old roadmap and she just didn't make the grade
There wasn't nothing wrong with her lovin'
She just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi
I got a doll in Pascadola I got a jewel in Gulf Port
And both of them more warm blooded that any woman I've made up north
And it's a cajun queen in Creole she must be six feet tall
When she starts lovin' now you just gonna climb up the wall
Ain't nothin' against the other states they just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi

When I reach the city limits I'm gonna stop upon the bluff
Nonchalantly get naked and go swimming in the gulf
Wash the north all off of me when I feel like it's done
I'm gonna crawl up on a rock and soak up all that southern sun
The sun shines in Minnesota but it don't shine like it do down in Biloxi

Then I'm going to missing persons I'm gonna turn my body in
And beg the police to shoot me if I try to leave again

Girl has got me on my knees
Baby baby babe don't make me wonder
Won't you let me in
She said - see you later
Shot down
I'll be back again

Good love is all you need
But you don't wanna know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

Dresses so tight
Moving to the beat
Set my feet on fire
Dream come true I want to give it to you
Let the flame get higher
Baby baby you're driving me crazy
Like a cat in a cage
You make me sh-sh-sh-shiver - earthquake
Down town to the blaze

Good love is all you need
Give me what I know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

You make me so hot
I feel my temperature rise
Don't shoot me down - No

When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

Cold blood is all you bleed

And it's over before it's done.

Well I know it'll be alright if I just get on the road,
If I run, I can free my worried mind,
Yeah I know on the day I die I will lose my heavy load,
But I wouldn't want to leave you behind.

Now I've grown into a man,
But Mr. Child still wants to run,
From the cradle to the van, oh.

If I run, I can free my worried mind,
Keep thinking of the day I die when I lose my heavy load,
But I wouldn't want to leave you behind,

Oh, Keep thinking it'll be alright if I just get on the road,

Words of comfort, words that never critisize!
Though I know you're simply laughing at me
I just can't stop and simply let it be!

Where are all those feelings, all my yesterdays
Feelings, now I have bring back those bitter ways 
Though I know you wanna turn and blow

Colin James,Sending A Message,"You're alone
You're inside
And the North Star is hanging above your home
It's so dark
And there is no sound
Except your heart beating away like a Morse code

Out it goes across the lake
The prairie grass lies down in waves
A thousand miles are gone when it comes through

You know that
I'm sending a message to you

Catching light as it goes by
Like comet trails streaking across the sky
And ride it down to anywhere you are

If I'm not right there next to you
And a word can't travel across the room
That anytime you're gone you're gone too far 

I, I'm sending a message out to you
I, I'm sending a message out to you

When you heat up the sound
Hold up your hands
The wave comes in at the edge of the land

Sending a message out to you
Sending a message, a message out to you

You smile
Because you feel it
Everything's starting to glow and you start to heal it

I, I'm sending a message out to you

John Mayer,Something's Missing,"I'm not alone
I wish I was
Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

closed my eyes and couldn't see you
but everything about you is revealing

you can take the blame from me
lock it up without the key

from you

and she don't notice
sometimes she puts the weight of the world

for dead and bleeding

but your friends all said you went away
but I think I got it right today
thought that there's a chance that you might need me

well do you?

[Quik] Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)
[Luda] Ay man let me ask you somethin man
[Luda] You ever have one of them days where you felt like
[Luda] you mighta got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
[Luda] Y'knahmean like you just got your paycheck
[Luda] Paid off a car note or somethin
[Luda] Just jumped out the shower feelin fresh than a muh'fucka
[Luda] Witcha good shoes on, y'knahmtalkinbout?
[Quik] You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?
[Luda] Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
[Luda] Like call e'rybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
[Quik] In Compton we call that spur of the moment
[Luda] Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin on child suppo't

[DJ Quik]
Well my baby momma is, because she see havin kids
as a tool for gettin chips, that's with or without the dip
She told my lawyer she's a nurse but she can't spell school
Quite frankly she's a motherfuckin fool, idiot
Welcome to the city where you might see thangs
Like real threats, fake breasts, negativity hangs
over the city like a puppet string, pullin you up
You think they love you 'til the director yells cut
Now they packin you with ice and zippin you up

[Chorus]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
[KJ] And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright
G'd up, my mind is freed up
[KJ] From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright

[DJ Quik]
Now on Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that's out to steal your bag and your jewels
But we check your medication just to see if you cool
You can't be dyin on us, after you live off of hemp
We party hard, like Ludacris Kim and Shock and them
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hen be
And hemp be the beats we flip thee and we pimps thee simply

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive, riiiiight

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite kipper
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
Now if it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Or you'll be wonderin where yo' house went
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show 'em in the back of my truck, at the FreakNic
Trick, what'chu workin with?

Now Gabby got the verbal that'll get your little wifey out her girdle
In a session with me lightin' up a little herbal
Turtle shell
School individuals that listen to me
Word it well
Given to the rapper who is livin to be heard and held
In a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt, my assault learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
""on a little"" life I'm livin in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a ""clip and send it rip         ""
Indigenous stork has just touched ground
Rappers organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap its like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead
I be the G-I-F-T test me hefty left's be gettin' swung
Cruise like a jet ski
Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all
Undisputed heavyweight lyrical southpaw

It's like a lime to a lemon-that rhymes, I assemble them
At times when I'm ""  "" they shine you remember
""  "" divine forces ""  "" that refine men & women &
I rhyme for a livin', not just for the scrilla man
That isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout
Uzi mc's I have arguments n' fallin' outs wit'
About what it's all about, ain't about foamin out the mouth
Like a walkin tall can of Guinness Stout
""        ""
When the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like, bing-bing
Eat 'em like, B-King, yet wit' no seasoning-bee sting
Wich yo girl dressed in a g-string she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, after they cash his ass
Is that an irate? Great!
Grade-A, top-choice lyricism
Hey, hit me wit' that shell shocked rhythm
One time fo' the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ
It don't stop

[Chorus]

I say we drop it on a (one), we drop it on a (two)
We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)
You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play
(from New York, NY) (to streets of LA) to (??)
You know we leave the party wreakin' a disaster
For the new ""millie"", rain like a shower
Let it seep in your pores (??)
Oh lord that's [scratch]
Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)
(cause I grab the mic) wit the intent to get ill
A natural that you know who is (still Mrs. Field's)
So slide to the side and (take it light) and (throw your hands in the air) all night (party people in the place...)
I make 'em suffer, to the fallen mc's I'd be the (quicker pickem upper) (galactic of a nebula)
I'm rappin the spectacular, attackin whack amateurs n' back stabbin salamanders
Creepin while I'm peepin on 'em (party time)
Before I used to hit the meetings it was (Thunderbird wine) (used to drink the Ole)
Now I drink Calistoga, sober and I'm older
But the world is still gettin colder (colder)
The Gift of Gab don't stop (the way I feel I have just got to rock)

Searching for home
My home
Searching for home

And you said the journies just footsteps home
In my head, Ill never be alone
And you said my life will tell a story
But Im still none the wiser, and I cant understand

Searching for home
Left all alone
I chose my road
I know Im a long way from home
Searching for home
My home
Im all alone

Cline Dion,The Reason I Go On,"When I'm feeling down the mention of your name
It lifts my spirit up
It makes me carry on when I don't have the strength
Your faith can heal me

Like the sun that shines
You give me light to see

Catch me 'cause I'm falling, I'm so lost inside your love
Can you hear me calling to your heart?
'Cause you're the one, the reason I go on

Could I find the words to tell you how I feel
With one look from your eyes?
I know what heaven's worth so I'd sell everything
To hold and touch you

You're the air I breath
The reason my heart beats

Catch me 'cause I'm falling, I'm so lost inside your love
Oh, can you hear me calling to your heart?
'Cause you're the one, the reason I go on
The reason I go on, yeah

Baby, I'm just dreaming

Casiotone For The Painfully Alone,Rice Dream Girl,"I was in the safeway store when I saw you in aisle four
I swear you looked so nice, you were buying milk that was made out of rice
I tried to think of something clever to say but you were already walking away
In an attempt to get my groove on I offered you my white castle coupon

The radio was playing seal, I tried to tell you how I feel
But then our shopping carts locked wheels and the moment just seemed wrong

Oh, won't you do what's right, put your groceries in my car tonight

There's a tale that must be told
Of our mysterious Misty Mountains
Behind all the songs I wrote
Lives an old man and his shadow
And they're whistling day and night
For whatever, whatever it's worth for
They are whistling for you and I

On a ranch in the wildness
There's a song that must be sung
About a blindfolded angel 
Who never learned the right from wrong
And though I don't know enough English
To describe its troubled mind
But for one thing I am certain 
Is that it sings for you and I

And I tried so hard to figure him out 
But I guess I'm only human
I've been watching him, drawing him
Analyzing him in every way
I could possibly think of

But that does not really help me
You gotta sit back and enjoy
You know Ochrasy raised and betrayed him
Now he sits there all alone
With his soul and his legend
And his epic melodies

And they are with us when we bleed
Yes, they are with us when we're crying 
And they are with us when we bleed",happy,1

Suicidal Tendencies,Human Guinea Pig,"(Suicidal Tendencies)

(From F.N.G. compilation, 1992)

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight
The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 

They said it was for science
But I'm the human guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig

My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes
The nightmare continues, I see through their lies
The papers keep turning, the tests never ends
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration

They said it was for science
But I feel like the human guinea pig

Time may have passed on, but I won't soon forget
The old sensation, pure frustration of a human guinea, guinea pig",sad,0

So sublime that we blow my mind

Runnin' through the woods laughing at the blues

With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat

Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just wanna play

Novembre,Triesteitaliana,"There at the borders
Cold and rigid guardians dressed of no life

We run and run in circles
Till the world stops spinning round
(Run in circles, and the world as we know it, spins in silence)

Till remaining breathless, panting
Overwhelmed by laughter

Starry skies of stains
Ultimately sorry
Uneducated random strokes of pain

It's a chain going backwards through the veins
Must sew up this wound and run away

I can feel their strenght
Through crooked-lightning desert pathways

Run and run and run the pathways
branching off through time
Two lone-wolves shared
the utmost silence of the time
(run, run the pathways as you share
the uttermost of silence)

I stood up and started moving with a childlike fascination
For those doors that don't have locks and the stairways that were blocked
So I dug through the obstruction, put my fist around the railing

And each step was far apart and far away from steps before it
And the air was getting thinner 'til I couldn't breathe at all
And if I happened to look behind me there were miles and miles of stairs
Enough so I couldn't see the doorway but I knew that it was there

And on the last step I was dizzy 'cause there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door and through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes, without a ceiling, everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger and suddenly I saw that I was

Upstairs and outside and
Freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me
The answer, the feeling and the truth

That I'm small

That I'm small
I'm smaller than the smallest fireball",happy,1

Lloyd Banks,South Side Story,"Yeh Yeh Yeh
I done learned from mistakes like who's my man
N' Who's not, like who's gon run and who's not
Like who's gon shoot if you shot
Who gon hold they own, who's not
Who gon change glocks

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]

When I was 10 years old I seen a nigga take 3 in the head
Probably around the same time you use to pee in the bed
I'd stay awake cause my nightmares was seein' him dead
The smell of burnt tires peelin after leavin him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stare at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin, fingers shakin, spittin up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
Their I stood stiffer than wood it's the homie that use to buy me candy
Now he's gone who's gonna provide his family
My air bring this shit up n' runnin I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn I wasn't suppose to see that shit
That's when I thought, it was more than 3 shots
It could have been the aimin for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around and my pops, he like 'what happened?'
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin', I can still hear him laughin'

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]

It was a regular day in southside, sprinklers n' kids runnin'
And all of a sudden heads turnin', somebody did sumthin
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it he lived around the block
Regular getting' money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walk across the park stuntin' and frontin'
Diamonds in his ears, diamond watch on, eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty and grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away
So he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected , shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy told him she'd be back in a second
But he ain't payin no mind called her a bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park, with no niggas with him and no nine
And then in no time an older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat
Left his face all crack
Told him to take all that
Hit him again popped his chain with a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]

Now all my days go by blowin that sicky icky
California made me picky
Chickenheads tryin' to stick me with a hicky
If we, roll up quickly, stick me, some was tipsy
The location don't matter I'm southside until they hit me
I'd be dead
If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
But I don't know scarface or Bushwick Bill, My heart spills
For the kids who ain't got nothing and who got to steal, and from my
Cousin I lost, lookd over the steerin wheel

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body",sad,0
Sister Hazel,Space Between Us (Album Version),"Took a left turn at Albuquerque
You went north and I went south
It's just time so don't you worry, Hard to wait but patience pays

Open my door the cupboard's bare
It's hard to give when nothing's there
All this shit and such confusion, Tell myself it's not an illusion 

CHORUS 

We need some space between us
Take a deep breath, Clear my head
We need some space between us
Fall the wall, And build a bridge
We need some space between us
Don't go out and get a New thing
Hey - Hey - Hey 

I've been here it's so familiar, Close the book I know the end
Want so much a different story, Want so much a different way 

Just so much well its just so much
And I'm up too close and I just can't see
Tryin' to think before I answer
And I'm trying' to walk before I run

Kris Kristofferson,Darby's Castle,"See the ruin on the hill
Where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home
Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon, 
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",sad,0
Bad Religion,Doing Time (Album Version),"See the fight
Old men crying, deny their ruin
Watch them try
The cynic laughs at the optimist's closed eyes

Darkness falls, curtain calls, the cynic's beer soon overflows
Other watches, has a seat, and from the same cup, they drink
I'm doing time, how long I don't know

William had 26
Blew his brains out, now look at him
John had only one
Watch the mother mourn her only son

I'm doing time, how long I don't know
I'll kiss goodbye my brain and body
And go to sleep for generations (2x)

Salvation
Cease concentration
You'll only lose the fight
Don't tell me what's wrong or right
You're losing sight
You're just gonna die anyway",sad,0
Shawn Colvin,Sunny Came Home,"Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

She says ""Days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire""

Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
And it's time for a few small repairs, she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

She says ""Days go by, I don't know why 
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire""

Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it

Oh, days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind

Take me away from all your lies.

Oh this awful life has a change as the hours
As you pass before my eyes

Like some old tumbleweed, my thoughts go tumblin' back home
In memories I recall those simpler times
And a way of life I never left behind

Down at the old corral
Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down
Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now
Down at the old corral

I remember everything I ever heard
Like how to judge a man's true worth, by how he keeps his word
That saddle wisdom never seemed to end
Everything I need to know I learned back then

To talk like dirt
To love yo like tar

With my north star
While you pull your hair out
I buy the drinks at the bar

Some people want nothin out of life
And some people want it all
Some people ain't livin life right
But fast money make God call
I'm prayin to the angels, but worship the devils
Yeah a nigga rich but I'm livin like a rebel
Ridin with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level
I grew up on a crop side, the New York Southside
Stayin alive was no jive
Standin on the strip you get stuck like velcro
Jake jump out, you see heads and elbows
Run nigga, run nigga, here they come nigga
Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger
Kid I'm still in the P's, girl I love the Audi
If yo' ass pregnant girl, leave the party
My stashbox so big, it could move the shotty
God it ain't my fault, if I shoot somebody
I ain't in it to lose, I'm in it to win
Sex, money, murder, take the safety off my sins (yeah!)

Buckle down, do anything for the dollar
Enough bills'll make your blood spill

Shiny trey-pound, black 9-mil
Magucci leather got me shoe crazy
Quarter mil' vehicle and I'm a oops baby
And if I'm wearin my chain it's 380
Like Fat Joe, nigga you crazy?
Man fuck friends, this T-dot-O-dot-S
Have it how you want, speed knot or pop chess
Police stompin niggaz by the twenty
And shootin by the fifty, ain't a damn thing funny

It feeds my kids, it fills my fridge
It pays my bills and the mortgage on the crib
It keeps me icy, it make hoes like me
It gives me, seats at the Garden next to Spike Lee
It made me rich, it made me change
I seen a lot of places and bought a lot of things
You got me haters, you got me drama
You paid for the lawyers, you paid for the llamas
You make niggaz goners, you rule all the corners

Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?

Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice a-whispering
Come away child

You were like one of those guys 
The kind with the wandering eyes 
But I said, hey, what the hell Once in my life I'll take a ride
on the wild side.

You were so full of yourself 
But, damn, were you cute as well 
You liked my legs, I liked your moves 
Anyone could tell not hard to deny that

I Did it again now I got it all wrong 
But it felt so right, I can't believe it 
And all the mistakes that went on for too long 
Wish there was a way I could delete them

Second night in a row I'm back in trouble (let's go), 
I don't get it (let's go) 
Gotta keep it down, 'cause the lobby called
But we ignore them (yes, I know), 'cause it's getting better

When it comes to men it's known 
That I end up choosing wrong 
'Cause I always trip and fall On the same old rock 
and repeat and go back

How blind a girl can be 
To miss you hide your ring 
Lied about everything I'm so nave 
And I should have known that

I Did it again now I got it all wrong 
But it felt so right, I can't believe it 
And all the mistakes that went on for too long 
Wish there was a way I could delete them

It may seem to you that I am in a place 
Where I'm losing the direction of my life 
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase 
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive

Coven,Coven In Charing Cross,"Thirteen cultists
Held a secret meeting,
Bringing powers of the darkness
Upon those who opposed them.
The cheif of the circle,
Known as Malchius
drank the blood of a young baby
Offered unto him.

They danced ecstatically,
The orgied frantically.
The demon had arisen
From the circle on the floor.
The chanting was much louder
And more piercing than before.

They are seven.
They are seven.
Seven are they.
Out of the abyss they rise,
When day sinks into darkness.
Seven are they.

Coven in charing cross...
Coven in charing cross...

Soon, a certain family
Living in the village,
Would die one by one by
The curse of the cult.
The head of the family,
A witchhunter named Mead,
had burned their leadser at the stake;
Soon he'd regret his deed.

Pain from Devil's we evoke!
Thirst and suffer til he'd choked.
The magic did take over
And the soul did feel the roar.
Incantations were much louder
And more piercing than before.

Born in the bowels of the hills
Evil ones, sources of ills.
Setters of unseen snares,
Death to all pity, all prayers.
Male they are not.
Female they are not.
No wives have they known.
No children begot.
The fiends they are seven,
Disturbers of heaven.
They are seven.
They are seven.
Seven they are.

And falling gently on the cushion

Dead Prez,Be Healthy,"It's all love.

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily,  to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
and, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
cause you dont want to loose - vitamins and minerals 
and that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable , so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy .
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin better care of ourselves.

Be Healthy Ya'll.

Take a little tip from the tabloid
Because I know I'm not paranoid

Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me

Took a little time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask all I had to do is ask the heather wall Akwame
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that ya try to impress Uncle Fester

No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew all left the passengers to die under the sea

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

State of the union address
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words: power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

Your place in hell
Your place in hell

'Guilty' is what our graves will read
No years, no family, we did
Nothing (nothing) to stop the murder of
A people just like us",sad,0
Helmet,Your Head,"That's the logical explanation
Destruction might assume charge or feed belief
Passing time again, fun out on the street
That's still juvenile preoccupation

Standing buttholes, the line goes down the block
Familiarity is more convincing
Funds available erect the monument
Dead is dead I guess
What's the cost of a head?

That fills your head but you're good for that",sad,0
Shaman,For Tomorrow (live),"Long ago, the world was one
We walked through the ice floes
To an unenduring land
Our future, our hope
There was something in the air,
The Age of the Unknown
Far beyond the sea of trees
The vision laid close

There's a place where the sun shines brighter
There's a mountain that climbs to the stars...

Day and night we built a reign
With heavenly desire
Sweat and dreams made up the bricks
That raised up our walls

Paying tribute to the gods
And blood kept on flowing
And the lust for knowledge
Was the sense of it all

Fly, fly to the stars,
Reach them on high
Bring back the answers of the night
Roll with the clouds,
Sing with the birds,
'Cos one day we'll have to say goodbye!

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Many years of harmony
The message arrived soon
Three big stars lined up together
A chill in the air...

The high-priest was dressed in black
On top of the stairways
Longing for the sacrifice
Of those who would dare

Fly, fly to the stars
Then let it fall
Into the emptiness of night
Our time has come
Time to move on
'Cos one day we have to say goodbye...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Come with me to Paradise
Let's return again,
Let's return again!

To be closer to the skies
Living on a dream,
Living on a dream...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way",happy,1

And I got 'em tied up tight, so your gon' find out tonight!

Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her but, act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor
The way I'd give up my heart 
But never know because shit I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling I'd holla that it's irrel'
I don't get myself caught in the jello jella, 
And pudding pops that other opt to call falling in love but
For the record have you ever rode a horse?
Likely you just sent me to Pluto, I said of course
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy I won't endorse
Han Solo till I'm hit by bullets, obey the force
Bewitch you, and I rich you in better time permits
For now show me samples, examples why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

Randy Travis,Wind In The Wire (Album Version),"I've been riding fence all day,
Way up on the summer range.
Found a place to make my bed
As the evening shadows spread
Beyond the campfire light,
In the stillness of night,
Came the call of a coyote choir,
And the song
Of the wind in the wire.

As it strummed the rusted strings,
It sang of long-forgotten things.
Many moons and many suns
Of the real Americans.
When the arrow and the bow
Stalked the range
Of the buffalo,
And the call of the coyote choir
Knew no song
Of the wind in the wire.

As the ghostly balladeer
Hypnotized me, I could hear
Bugle calls, and battle cries.
Broken promises and lies.
The spirits of the plain
Still sing their sad refrain
In the call of the coyote choir
And the song
Of the wind in the wire.",sad,0

So it's gotta be worth it to me

But after all only time's gonna tell

Is a fire that burns
To the core of me
When will I ever learn

I could walk away
But that wouldn't be like me
I could turn my face
But then I couldn't see
You coming back to me 
I'm waiting for that day

I've got a great big problem
You can't ever get to the bottom of 
My love, no matter what you do 
I can't let you go
I've got a great big problem
You can't ever get to the bottom of 
My love 
I can't let you go

You refuse to be
The one I meant for you to be
If you could only see
How this is killing me
You'd come back to me
I would set you free

I call your name 
But it's always the same
You walk away

The nail in coffin just by being

I'm not the Master of the Universe,

Made my pretension and fulfilled the worst,
My past is cursed, the wrong way.

I walk the earth the wrong way,
Made my pretension and fulfilled the worst,
My past is cursed, the wrong way.

And when I die I'm gonna fly,
And come and get you.
And when you try and run,
I'll be the curse above you.

In the race for disaster I will come in first,

Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
But now that leaving you has come
And when he touches me, I can't feel you anymore

You're so late with your new plans for two
He had lots of nights to love me away from you
But the first time that he touched me I was sure
When he touches me I can't feel you anymore

When he touches me, I can't feel you anymore

Let me tell you from the start I know it now by heart
He says the same things to me he says the same things to me

And if your heart is breaking think how I must feel
And did he tell you there's no other girl that his only love is you
If he did there's no surprise that's just the way he lies

If when you see that other blonde there's something you can tell her
She need not fool her time away tryin' to steal my feller

That lonesome town and those good times have marred my way back home

And leave you without a trace.

The youth them getting restless and they don't want you near. 
Your watching us your watching us it so improper 
We've seen your kind before we call it informer.
Storm trooper storm trooper where will you go? 
This world she no like you so you better stay low. 
And up from the mountains and out from the trees, 
That is where you come from you crawl like the one disease.

So now you pass me the laser beam 
And you want me to join the team. 
Well Im not used to these kinds of things, 
But this is what the evil brings. 
Let me tell you bout the fire. 
You could bring the waters up above. 
I'll bring my favorite people and I'm bringing all my love. 
You want a battle well don't look very far, 
You want to fight somebody come fight the superstar. 
I knew you wouldn't stand a chance you left without a passing glance, 
There's nothing you could ever do to keep me from stopping you

(verse 3:) 
It's so dark and lonely out here in outer space, 
But at least I got my keyboard and my low bot has his bass.
Playing street sweeper tunes and watching TIE fighters fly by.

Burning pakalolo not even noticing the weather 
So far and so alone a million light years away.

I got my blaster set I'm ready to start a minor war.

Time to get back to my daily routine have a beer at a bar on Tattooine.

You take away everything, make my people scream out loud. 
Just bring it back 
Lord just bring it back. 
You mess it up and you rearrange open your eyes and turn the page. 
Just bring it back.

Bob Carlisle,Man Of No Reputation,"It was said this man was of no reputation
Yet He could stop the rising storm
With a gesture of His hand
But He chose to use His hands to heal
Hearts of darkness, hearts of stone
Just like mine would be revealed

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loved the weak with relentless affection
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were
He was a man of no reputation

It was said this man brought only confusion
That He'd achieve his ends by any means
And the truth that it brings revolution
And for once they were right
The truth set us free

The hearts of the captive were his only concern
And the powerful knew their days were ending

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loved the weak with relentless affection
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were
He was a man of no reputation

One day soon the gates of heaven will open wide
And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride
But for now we live on these streets
Forbidding and tough

Where push always comes to shove
And it's said love's never enough
Where a prophet in rags gives hope to a fearful world
No injustice, no heart of darkness
Will keep this voice from being heard

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loves us all with relentless affection
And He loves all those poor in spirit, come as you are
To the man of no reputation",sad,0
Eminem,Ricky Ticky Toc,"Once you call my name out things will never be the same
They should have never let us get off foot in this game

Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
The one with Benzino did

I'm waitin for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it
To fuckin' pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated 
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it

Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money

It's like a monopoly
They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me 
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery

And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we rhyme like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other 
In time we discovered that we had more in common 
Then we thought with each other

Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us
Two hard motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in chunking cause

Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin
Even if I'm under the gun 

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin
'Fuck Compton'

I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet

Gym Class Heroes,New Friend Request (Amended Version),"I remember when I first laid eyes on you 
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi 
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line 
You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress
 
And I didn't take it personal 
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send 
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing 
Honestly it only made me want you more 

Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go 
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you 
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips 
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips 

I was on this website late night lurking 
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent 
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game 
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name 

But the fact that you hittin' me back made me smile 
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile 
You caught me at the most pivotal moment
So now I'm emailing my love with a dozen digital roses 

So click approve, so simple 
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move 
Just click approve, come on girl

Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move 
Just click approve, come on girl 
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose 

Let's face it, it's a sad situation when we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations 
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point 
So this is me at my most honest 
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis 

Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit 
On a scale of one to awesome I'm the shit 
Just get over it, it happened god damn it, I've been waitin too long 
Even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go 
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)

But it's hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace 
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game 
All my money's on the latter, this is not a LOL matter 
Why would you pass up a chance this great? 

If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for 3 days 
Rephrase
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority, I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face 
But all I got is this Powerbook and iChat 

Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back 
I stay on my feet
Shit
And be persistent 'til my name is under who you would like to meet

Just click approve, come on girl 
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose 

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name 
All I know is that I'm smitten with your pictures wishin' you would feel the same 
I admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments 
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense 

Lately I been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought 
But it's all wishful thinking 
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out 
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something 

I check my inbox ten times and ain't nothin'
You probably busy doing something sexy 
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in 
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me 
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be 
So yeah it's time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry 
This is madness, XOXO dash Travis

Ride it down to Central Street

Catch my baby out on a midnight train

Lord, I'm gonna quit my bad way of livin'
And visit the Sunday school.

The Black Crowes,Girl From A Pawnshop,"With pawnshop eyes and a second hand frown
She sat silent at the table
Her boots were brown, well should she leave town
To play the role of lover expatriate
A nod to the waiter, always her flirty behavior
You know she always gets one on the house
She pulls out a letter
From a bag under her sweater
And before she reads she straightens her blouse

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

And out of respect, well really must confess
I never lost your number
I never lost your address
And if we remain friends at best
Sometime later no, no not yet
We'll smile and remember it like this

She put back the letter
One tear falls like a feather
And disappears on the bar room floor
The gratuity included
You know the letter concluded
P.S. with all my love

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

I said P.S. all my love
P.S. all my love
P.S. all my love",sad,0

They've got bombs that spread disease
Who's driving your aeroplane

Who are these people populating the Earth
They're everywhere, who can you trust

Emperor,With Strength I Burn,"Deep Green Dark Chaos
Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ahh...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn...",sad,0

But there's always something more

But how was I to know
Now that I've discovered it
I have to let it go
Exactly what I needed
So tell me what was wrong
Something so intangible
You never really miss it till its
Gone

This bed of roses that I'm in
Turns out as only thorns and stems
I used to recognize this place
For what it's worth
But not today
It wasn't all that long ago
When I was perfect on my own
I used to thrive on my mistakes
Few as they were
But that has changed

Everything I knew
An illusion to me know

On our own understanding

And the times can get too bad

So we learn that life is something
We can't do alone

God is waiting until we let go

When the foundation's shaking
Love will take control
Heavy laden in the shadows
On our knees, out in the cold

Fallen and needing a Savior
We must know that there is help
When we finally give in, oh
Shattered and trembling
We can find strength unending in Him

In the icy shadows
In the bitter cold

Of this tragic accident, where a car has ran into a building.
The person in the car was positively identified as rap star Twista.
Apparently, he went _Kamikaze_.  The big question is,
Will the rapper survive?\""

You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You got a right to survive, ohhh, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it - you've gotta fiiiight

Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam
But I kill 'em all, cause _Kamikaze_ was the bomb
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it
This cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uhh
(You got a right to survive)
But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin my body in chalk
(You're gonna make it)
Look at me now cause I'm standin on top of the globe (say what)
Makin big money for spittin my popular flow (say what)
Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin 'em medicine
It's not a given to work cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit don't affact us effect us they wanna imagine
They take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found
And _Kamikaze_ was successful now c'mon and feel _The Day After_

Did I neglect all that mattered?

Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

You want to be the kind of woman
Who will be his one and all
You know it makes him happy
Know how to give a thrill
So you do what you have to
Or some other woman will
You go down on him again
Do you hide inside yourself
So that you don't bother him
Do you laugh and shrug it off
When resentment begins
You know he doesn't give back
As much as he could
Would you slit your throat to sate him

Won't you tell me please (tell me) what's the master plan (master plan)
Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (only God knows), so I'll just move the crowd
Now I break out of my physical shell and exhale past this so called body
Used to go to the party, but now I sit and chill with a pen and a pad
Dropping ill philosophical science me and my dad, we talk about life and how it started
How we departed from life's path and probable right math
The task at hand is making people understand that were not who we think we are
But in this land of the lost the cost of souls could be so high
People be gettin high, wondering why we die
But it's all planned, forget your fear take the hand
We keep on returning cause the lessons need learning
Concerning (what) fact I sing and I rap, I hold this mic contact
Critics can step back and analyze, I energize, cosmic rays of days the igno
Then get my signal for the sun

Heaven only knows, cause I don't understand (don't understand)
Won't you tell me please (cause I pray everyday) what's the master plan (the master plan)
Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (only God knows), so I'll just move the crowd
So uh riddle me this, riddle me this like this
Melodical prodigal flows, hypnotical blows to brain pieces (ooh)
Telekinesis (ahh) when I reach this pinnacle, cynical, clinical
Microphone autobots, waiting on lotto spots, trying to rock
But yo they can't understand, there's only one plan
The time is at hand, in the year two zero one one
The people of the sun return to save the righteous children
Now, I know you wanna be on top of the world
Giving a diamond and pearl to your girl
Watching your jacuzzi swirl (uh), seems like material lust
We need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust (me)
It's kinda hard you rhyme sometimes everybody wants to scrutinize
Redefine who you are, but every person is a star
So let your light shine far, and praise god
(Chorus)
Heaven only knows (only knows now), cause I don't understand (don't understand now)
Won't you tell me please (tell me please) what's the master plan (I wanna know the plan)
Spend so many days (many days), sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (yo if you feel this sing it wit me now), so I'll just move the crowd
La la la la la la la la la la I'll just move the crowd for now (gotta move the crowd (x3)
La la la la la la la la la la (la la) I'll just move the crowd for now
Somebody told me they said uh
If you free them (uh huh) they will start revolution and Babylon can not defeat them

Mirah,Apples in the Trees (Live),"There should be no hesitation 
When the coast is clear 
You got a right to slide 
Right into place when the end is almost here 

So you think you got some rotten deal 
What a way to compromise 
It's a long long way 
Before you get to claim that final prize 

Looking at that sorry face 
I can recognize the fear 
But if you keep on looking up at night 
The stars will all appear 

See there's food for me, 
There's food for you 
There's gold that's in the air 
There's oceans deep and wide 
And there is love beyond compare 

There's apple in the trees

There's hope for you and me

Tom Cochrane,Revelations:  Visions In A Dream,"The innocent and the poor
They've got nothing to hide
But the rich recite in numbers
Their fear resounds in side

Children starve by the millions
The false of the lame
Of the foolish few who knew them
Then led them to the shame

The king he knights the players
They all know the score
But nobody told his mistress
She was pushing forty-four

I don't want to know
Where we're heading for
We don't have long to go
We'll hear footsteps in the dawn

'Cause it's just some sort of
Crazy ride we're on 


The queen she knows the exit
She's been there once or twice
Whe her saviour got ostricized
For selling free advice

And her knight in shining armour
Comes sliding through the door
Sporting suggestive glances
At all the dancers on the floor

Well I dreamt all those lonely people
I knew them by their names
But their faces lost their identity
In the fury of the flames

They talked in foreign riddles
Lik actors on a stage
But when the word came they were standing scared
Lost in a doomed age

Here is the reason you should listen and learn
'Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
'Cause after all the highs, you're gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
'Cause if you don't have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit

And straight to hell is where they're trying to take us

Petra,Don't Let Your Heart Be Hardened (This Means War Album Version),"Words and music by Bob Hartman 
Based on Psalm 95:7-8, Hebrews 3:13

(Chorus) 
Don't let your heart be hardened - don't let your love grow cold 
May it always stay so childlike - may it never grow too old 
Don't let your heart be hardened - may you always know the cure 
Keep it broken before Jesus, keep it thankful, meek, and pure 

May it always feel compassion - may it beat as one with God's 
May it never be contrary - may it never be at odds 
May it always be forgiving - may it never know conceit 
May it always be encouraged - may it never know defeat 

May your heart be always open - never satisfied with right 
May your heat be filled with courage and strengthened with all might 

Let His love rain down upon you 
Breaking up your fallow ground 
Let it lossen all the binding 
Till only tenderness is found",happy,1

And I know I'm gonna spend all my life alone

That's when I need to cover up my heart and soul
I only gain perspective when I lose control
Is it better to be crying when you feel insane
Or laughing out loud dancing naked in the rain

Have you ever felt a thunder deep inside your heart
Lettin' go of all the shit that's gonna tear you apart

Nobody knows who you are (Nobody knows who you are)
Nobody cares who you are
Nobody knows why you feel

Amoral,The Last Round,"When you tricked them into your condemned dream
You didn't know who would have control

Where it took seconds to shape fortunes
Your pains it weighed down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know made you so frail

Empty eyes look through the barrel, sweating fingers on the gun
One push off the threshold to target sympathies
Just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged
So close and still no place where anything would end

Trapped between blooded walls
And the fight was there today
Fists breaking against the concrete
None to forgive no strength to run

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up you wish them to cry
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning to burn away

Suffocating in the grasp of this hate
Driven to fire your last round
Escape from the air and drown under the earth
Dead mirror by the wayside, nowhere to turn

An empty shell buried to the ground
Prepare yourself to forfait
Another saviour just another failure
Where bleak winds grind the surface

Fear and regret stain dim recollections
An act of rash solutions
Last one there, the broken statue
Built with hands that are bleeding

Empty eyes look through the shattered image
And their pain it weighs down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know make you so frail

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up they are holding your time
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning",sad,0

In sleeps velvet veil
On dream crystal potions
Behind silken sails
Cold marble laughter
Is taking my mind
2 a world of illusion
Spaceless in time

Oh Magdalaine listen 2 my call
Magdalaine catch me when I fall

For years I have wandered
In solitude cried
I reach out 2 touch
The love so denied
Smell of magnolia
Your presence is near
My love is eternal
Perfect and clear

Magdalaine listen 2 my call
Catch me when I fall
Lost as the ocean
High as the sky

Voices violent eyes
Ruby death and stormy skies
Zodiac child of fire
Everlasting sweet desire

And conjure pagan ritual lust
We cast our spell into the sky
We sacrifice a life to live, some one must die
He's calling, he's calling, he's calling
There will be blood tonight
A sacrificial lamb in white
There will be blood tonight
The ceremony flames ignite
There will be blood tonight
A virgin drowns in the sea of light
Come all you faithful while the moon's full
Just believe and thy work will be done here
The council for the cauldron
Secret coven, reach for clear
The holy spirit gemini
The seven sisters two of nine
Now wait for the sign
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming
There will be blood tonight
Messiah come reveal your light
There will be blood tonight
Our sacred shadow rise to life
There will be blood tonight
A hanged man soul is our dark knight
From him which is witch's to come
Salvation for archangel's son
Washed our sins with his own blood
Drowning rats die in the flood
He who's faithful he who's bled
The first begotten of the dead
Eat her flesh and burn with fire

To love without fear

And finally I find that I am strong enough
To listen to this voice within
Telling me to throw all caution to the wind 

My heart beats like thunder
And I am not afraid
'Cause baby you showed me the way

A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
Oh, I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer

As I think of the heart that I've broken
And all the golden chances that have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer",happy,1

I been waiting for this moment for some years 
I've been torn down enough to know 
Everyone goes through this door 
Just before their lives explode 
Come in here with a heavy load

Walking down the road watching the day begin 
Radio song is playing off in a distant wind 
But you can feel it its a gentle love 
Coming out soft from the windows above 
Just when you have had enough 
Here comes the world you've been dreaming of 

Oh my my the Mystic River 
She takes your heart 
And you will forgive her 
Lay me down beside the water 
I look across at the sons and daughters 

Sun comes up each day to chase away the moon 
Even the stars at night they fade away too soon 
You can't do much about the trouble life brings 
Cut all the lines so the phones don't ring 
But stay here once from spring to spring 
Watching the ice melt the mornings sing 

Oh my my the Mystic River 
She takes your heart 
And you will forgive her 
Lay me down beside the water 
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now 

There's a tree that grows out in the burning sands 
Never a drop of rain that nobody understands 
You can push me I don't mind 
Leave me out here and I'll be fine 
Cause everyone's gonna have their time 
Up or down honey you decide

Pulled the four-four up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet

Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
The game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the big bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' 'em up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

A newspaper blown through the grass

Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

How terribly strange to be 70

Silently sharing the same fears",sad,0

With revulsion 
Comes the spite 

With the light

This infamy is not for us 

With the night 
Comes deliverance 
Comes the spark 
That sets us alight 

With the dark 
Comes remembrance 
Comes the halo 
Comes the flight 

And the ground takes a fall 

Torn upon winds of witchery 
Resplendent wings unfold 
Revelling in lucid lechery 
We invoke what no eye can behold 

Azure, her gaping portal 
I blaze in ecstasy 
The goddess calls, immortal 
Shrugs off all treachery

Wait for evenfall 
For the night to embrace us again 
Wait for evenfall

Revealing secrets
Knowing I be dealing deep shit
It's all good, I'm growing stronger daily
I'm father to babies, I bomb you crazy
Got more knowledge
Than you can get from the Internet
I spit wisdom that I get from introspect

Don't they see the world's tired of them
They're lying again
Got the music dying again, nah

But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well whaddya know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move fakin
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, Nyquil will help you get your Z's troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin, I've had it up to here
My days of payin dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (YEAH)
Head for the border, go get a taco
I'll be wreckin from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Layback on the payback, (evolve rotate the gates?) CONTACT!
Can I get a hit? (HIT!)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stompin, rippin and rompin
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out!
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new 
but the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me! Yo, what's the scenario

Scores for the snores that's lovin dance floors

Papes make grapes great for the waist
I'm an L-AH, an E-ADER, simply just a leader
Bass in his face means peace see ya later
Later? (LATER!) Later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and my Earth the inflater

Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo how's that sound (ohhhhhh!)

It's the leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here!)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime cause so ain't no CRIMINAL

No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test, yo whattup little kid?
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, AND ATTACKED
Then baby puked then you had TO SMACK
Causin rambunction, throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom, inside the ear

So don't violate or you get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Heel up, reel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact BOOM! from the cannon

Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

Uh, uh uhh, alone with the track man
Uh, pardon me, uhh, as I come back
As I did it yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel to the Sun I roll with the squadron
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are saggin
Try to step to this, I will, fits you in a turban
And had you smellin right, like some old stale urine

The rear cock diesel, for chicks they were kickin
Yo, bustin out before the Busta bust a nut

Dark Fortress,Ghastly Indoctrination,"In mysterious ways your soul sinks down
As eerie constellations told before
This time you cannot hide
A maelstrom of inhuman fears
And the only way goes down... down... down...

Gone days of phantasmagoria
Welcome to the necromantic gallery
Where nightmares become so real
And souls are stigmatized with the sign of impurity

Desolation all around
Welcome to the promised land
Where no single beam of light ever touched the ground
Life eternal in a traumatic fade

Believe me this is not a dream
These dead eyes you are gazing at are yours
Call it heaven, call it hell..

Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!
Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!
Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!

Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, 
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 

 (Oh)
 (So)
 (Oh)
 (So)


Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful.",happy,1
Mariah Carey,Mine Again,"I remember when you used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to love you right
But now if I only had the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart still believes

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

Its irrelevant to dwell in the past
I'm accountable for what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying for another chance
Just to have you back
'cause I've grown
And I know how to be your everything

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

Oh, no it ain't over yet
I just can't accept the possibility
We were made for each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Boy, maybe we could bring it back 
Maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back
To life

Maybe you could be mine again",sad,0
Frankie J,Gone,"Damn...I miss you
MMM...ooh

I toss and turn...it's so hard for me to sleep
I guess I'm no used to being alone...yeah
And I know it's because of me
And I'm trying to face this reality
Past relations they've made me into this man that I am
Knowing now that it's wrong
It's too late cuz she's gone

Gone...gone...gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone...gone...gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly
Being strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it she's gone...gone

This house is cold
It's like doing time in the pen
Wondering where she is and who she with...yeah
But the hardest thing is there's no one else to blame but me
So I guess I have to take it like a man
But I don't know if I'll ever love again
yeah...yeah

Cuz this pain I'm feeling inside is like a hollow point through my heart
I know that it's kinda crazy
But I feel like I'm falling apart
Usually I'm so cool, but I lost it when
She walked away
Lost without her...and she's gone

Gone...gone...gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone...gone...gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly
Being strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it she's gone...gone

Without some kind of intervention
I can't go on another day...oh
And I can't even bare to mention
The very sound of her name
Without the sky turnin into clouds
Without the rain falling down
Falling down...again...again
I can't face the fact that she's gone

Gone...gone...gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone

Matisyahu,Refuge,"Ani auni vevyone. Hashem yashav li. Ezrati, umafalti, atau. 
As for me, I am poor and destitute. Hashem my G-d will think about me. My help, my rescuer, you are. 

My word is like a hammer like a shattering rock, 
crack through your heart and take the evil apart 

From the end of the earth unto you I call, time and again I fall, back to you I crawl 
You have been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy 
Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times 
You can't have my heart I'm taking back what's mine 
I know it lie just smoke in your eye and you saved my soul from the other side 

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me 
For you have been a refuge 

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall 
May the king answer you on the day that you call 
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled, 
heavens lay draped over New York like a prayer shawl, 
the holy one enthroned upon the praises of Israel 

Pathways of my heart clogged like a traffic jam 
From the start, I want to take the blockage apart",sad,0

He pulls her on the floor to dance
Oh no, I don't understand
He don't even know who I am

He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me

But I remember the smell of his cologne
And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again

No, he's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him

Tom Cochrane,Washed Away,"We live out here in the desert
Where time stands still in the face of our foolish pride
We trade our love for ambition
And tell each other we'll get it on back in time
But time moves on like a river
She leaves us all behind
Like a summer rain it all gets washed away

Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know
If you find a love you better let 'em know or you both get washed away

Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know
If you find a love you better hold on fast or you both get washed away

I watch the wind blow out there, maybe hear some distant laughter
look outside the hotel window and my soul wanders off me
This is the time I'm mentioning and I won't soon forget that 
your proud beauty lingers on until the storm is lifted
Go find your fortune fast, its cold outside but you'll make it
Don't trade your love for ambition, or you'll get washed away

Chorus
Love clich and you used to tell me some things better change all things won't last
Do the best you can, it'll all work out at the end of the storm you get to love another day

If you find a love you better hold on fast or you both get washed away

Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know
If you find a love you better let 'em know or you both get washed away

Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know
If you find a love you better hold on fast or you both get washed away

Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know

I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer 
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm makin 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future 
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle
But niggaz is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

Let my nuts hang down to the flo' main
Smokin that dang dang, makin mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me
Cruisin down the block, just like I was a squirrel
In a world full of nuts, damn

Speakin of breakin, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fuckin around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringin the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kickin it
Comin around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass

Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair

The Fabulous Thunderbirds,Why Get Up,"Carter-Ellsworth

Why get up, why get up
How can I get up, why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever why get up

Phone keeps ringing right off the hook
Some bill collector, I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed, dream all day
World outside bugs me anyway
When I get things going, the going gets rough
So I ask myself why get up

Chorus

Went to the doctor, he said lose some weight
If you don't do it quick, we'll have to operate
I talked to my lawyer, he said case is closed
That woman got it all even the garden hose
Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck
Better roll back over why get up

Chorus

Well I can't quit drinking, I'm nervous all the time
When I wake up, it's like a ton lead on my mind
What was it, I said to that girl last night
She really got upset, I best stay out of sight
I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff
I better duck under the cover why get up",sad,0

My mind starts sweating my heart
It starts a chain reaction
That's now the pain it all starts 

It's going down where no one can see
It's a sad sad sight
The feeling just gets stronger
I see you, I just put on a smile
I try to cover it up
But I can't take it too much longer 

Time stands still, as I lie in place
I try to block out the pitch
In my head that keeps ringing
So I pound and pound on myself
I try to wake myself up
But I can't 'cause I'm not dreaming 

It's going down in my dark side
With no release or escape
Doesn't beleave in forgiveness
It's an emotion rape 

It's going down where no one can see
It's sad sad sight
No suspense as what will follow
Fractured terror fills my peace
Shocks my senses
Leaves me empty sad and hollow 

Time stands still, as I lie in place

In my head that keeps ringing

I try to wake myself up

It's going down in my dark side
Shivers and shakes through my soul
Ration surveys the damage
There's nothing left to control 

It's going down now, I'm face to face
With the hollowness
That echos in this darkness
How can I fight when I cannot see what to fight
Reluctanly how can I even stop this
All hell is breaking loose
Now panic rules as emotions blazed on fire 

I'm goin' down down down down down
I'm goin' down
I'm so damn tired

Rio de Janeiro in an afternoon

Juggernauts carving up the countryside
Cars by the million on a one-way ride
Using up the future

All that you fear, they're telling you can't happen here

The K.G.B. and the men in grey
Wonder if I'm going to see another day
Somewhere in the future

Take what you want but you can't take mine
Everybody's living on the Siegfried line
Worried 'bout the future

He's fighting for his own true love
His foes he does defy
He is the darling of my heart
My Southern soldier boy

Oh if in battle he was slain
I'm sure that I should die
but I'm sure he'll come again
And cheer my weeping eye

But should he fall 
In this our glorious cause
He still would be my joy 
For many a sweetheart mourns the loss
Of a Southern soldier boy

I hope for the best
And so do all
Whose hopes are in the field
I know that we shall win the day
For Southerns never yield

And when we thing 
Of those who are away
We'll look above for joy
And I'm mighty glad

Like a window looking out into eternity
But even though this feels like heaven
We know that it is just... 

The edge of the dream
The start of the plan
It's the way we begin to understand
The endless stream
The depths of His love
We got a long way to go
But the thrill is to know
It's just the edge of the dream

Feel the strength, the tenderness
He's given us a glimpse of His Holiness
As our souls flow together
Let us step on over...

Into the heart of His plan

The endless stream
The depths of His love

We want to live as Your children
And move closer, closer, closer

When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen my girl forced to take
Pain, tragedy, and much heartache
The tears she hides, the smile she fakes
And through it all, she doesn't break

I don't know where she finds the strength
I'm only glad that she can
Just when I think my girl is down
She's on her feet again

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen her world before my eyes
Get filled with evil, painful, spiteful lies
Still she fights, still she tries
And she will fight until she dies

Still she fights and still she tries

I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
but I know you always did your best
in the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
and say this prayer for you tonight,
because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know: 
sometimes we're helpless and alone,

Is life a mystery to you
Are you stumbling around
Without clues
Well take heart, even though you
Are weary
And worn, clear to the bone
Just remember that you're not
Alone

You just hold on
Don't be afraid
You just hold on to the Promised
One
You just hold on
Don't be dismayed
He'll never let you down
You better hold on
You have been chosen
Just hold on to the Promised One
You better hold on
Believe in the Lord Of Love

When it seems that the trials and
Troubles of life are larger
Than you
Follow Him He will see you
Through

Don't be ashamed when your
Soul is weak
Just believe in the one you seek
The God Of Truth won't betray
You
He sent his Spirit to stay with you",happy,1
Patty Griffin,Moses,"Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

But everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles 
And tells me how well he is walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

An everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
Go home to an empty apartment and call a best friend who is queer

Diamonds, roses, I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain, of pain",sad,0
The Doors,Strange Days ( LP Version ),"Strange days have found us
Strange days have tracked us down
They're goin' to destroy our casual joys
We shall go on playing or find a new town

Strange eyes fill strange rooms
Voices will signal their tired end
The hostess is grinning
Her guests sleep from sinning
Hear me talk of sin and you know this is it

Strange days have found us
And through their strange hours
We linger alone
Bodies confused
Memories misused
As we run from the day
To a strange night of stone",sad,0

Carl Smith,Loose Talk,"So long we've been married last burdens we've carried
Though fate kept us humble and made our love true
But plans that we made up someone seems to break up
Oh darling what else can we do
We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
For I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone

When I go out walking there's lots of loose talking
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all of my heart
We may have to leave here...

They say you are leaving that you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm
And hope that's the truth they will see
We may have to leave here...",happy,1

Amil,Anyday,"Anyday 

(Verse 1)
Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at 
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things,
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and Im just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field

(Chorus 2x)
Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday

(Verse 2)
Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go

Chorus

(Verse 3)
I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds",sad,0

When I rolled out on his ass on the solo

Because of these hot ones that explode on contact 
A maniac just prepared to die in combat 
Besides all that my 4-4 keeps my laced: Dawg he paid and safe 
I can see the fear in your face as I reach my waist for this warm embrace 

(Chorus) 
I got plenty love for the 4-4 
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go 
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the 4-5 
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride 
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the nine-mill 
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill 
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace 
All you muthaf**kas better duck and hide 
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside 
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace 

(Mayz) 
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives 
With my customized 4-5 
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys 
You muthaf**kas better get wise 
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin' to kill the elite 
'Cause you ain't gettin' no more tries 
Make the nigga's nubian mother weap, but f**k it 
As long as I don't get whole cries 
Put the beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise 
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five 
Make sure that nigga crossed me dies 
You don't wanna throw them thangs 
When I cocked and aim (?) think in these few seconds time 
But Mayz ain't new to the game 
I use the spark when we start to light up this thunderin' crime 
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin 
(?) pretend to be your friend 'til they get close enough to your ends 


To do you in, that shit puts me on ten 
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend 
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin' big shit about war 
Like he don't know my stee, now mob's gon' win 
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name 
'Cause I put a f**kin' bullet into your closest skin 
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe 
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin 
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace 
Before I f**k up your face like a can of mace 
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case 
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace 

(Chorus) 

(Twista) 
Would you (..?..) of the team, for sure 
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go 
Miss millimeter's makin' the (?) muthaf**kas gotsta be ruckus 
When I get my clutches upon this hoe 
Itchin' to let the barrel blow 
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow (..?..) 
Spit 'em up and swallow slow 
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back 
Payback from flashback, some bitches know 
Bust 'til I see the chrome from the intro 
You was f**ked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion 
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked 
F**k the gauge and enemies get (?) up from the blazin' 
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass 
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list 
Deposition die for servin' them six 
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick 
'Cause I be working my bitch 
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang 
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon 
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds 
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug 
When it comes to (?) run about she draw my blood 
Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud 
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug 
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock 
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess 
F**k the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls 
If I see I'll be laid to rest, let me hit the sex 
Lose (?) but used to be a problem solver 
But the nina made me a baller 
Go strapped and take the place of the black nine 
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste 
From my warm embrace 

(Chorus) 

I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4 
Warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 
Warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill",happy,1
Pursuit Of Happiness,No Safe Place,"I've got a little girl, though I know it won't be long
Before she finds another boy who will sit her by the fireplace
And sing her a song
It feels like there's no safe place
In a world that's come apart
And the deafening sound of a bursting bubble
Wakes you up with a start
Is there nowhere that is safe
Why can't we change the rules so I win
All I need is an escape
A temporary place to hide
When she's coming in the door when she's walking out the door
hard to tell which is worse
That false feeling of relief when she comes in
Or the empty feeling when she's gone
And every night on the streets the forces of darkness
Score another victory
And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil
To make a martyr of me
[chorus]
Fold up the tents and load up the trucks
'cause it's time to move on
If we only knew where to go
I hope that we'd already be gone
And even when we're lying together, I make sure she falls asleep first
It seems when things are at their best, my mind starts to wander
to things at their worst
So do I fall asleep and dream of a peace that never will come
Or do I roll over and let her break the glass around my heart
And set off the alarm

Redman,Jam 4 U,"*inhales, starts coughing*
Yo, this is for motherfuckers -- that talk that sellout shit

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

""Get down, get down, on down.."" like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I ""Get on up!"" rhythm and funk
Makes you hump like Technotronic I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""to chill..."" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ahhhhhh, you guessed it!"" I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

Check this out here, let the rough cut cut your ear
Hit Squad's the crew I'm twenty-two and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip, the crowd in half on the sneak tip
Til they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a bu-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-dan-ding
Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... on your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O.
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)

Silverstein,BLEEDS NO MORE (Live Version),"My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else 
But I've broken both my legs falling for you 
Drag me on the ground.

Powerless I stand,
Tarnished blade, cutting through, 
Pushed into my vein, blood still stains my hands 
Sharpening my sense of pain outside

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else 
But, I've broken both my legs falling for you 
Drag me on the ground.

Killing everything off inside. 
Make sense of everything you tried to hide, 
hide from me. 

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone. 
My stomach feels sore from cutting up. 
But, I ruined all my sanctity for you. 
Smash me on the ground. 

I wanted to convince myself there's nothing else to do 
I wanted to provide you with proof of what you put me through
I wanted to pretend that it was you.
(You're the worst thing that ever happened to me!)

Die!
Killing everything off inside
Make sense of everything you tried to hide 
Hide from me

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else

Smash me on the ground.",sad,0
Twista,It Feels So Good (Album Version),"(INTRO) This goes out to all riders worldwide
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
where playa hatin killers and the hood niggaz thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive

(Verse 1)
One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home cuz one of them
got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit 
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin too much though
We just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes 
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
and slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
and we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
but hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
cause it feels so good

(Chorus)
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good 
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes 
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go

(Verse 2)
Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
when niggas we lust smokin some but the flame tight
Trippin off how we survivin the rugged terrain
and try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night 
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap
Even we sent Deebo back to back to back
We still be holdin' stacks of packs
Rollin through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Rollin the chrome out really trippin
because we take the smoke to the dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones
glisten from all the sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight
Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques 
Now together we mush
but when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin every one of y'all my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hopin to get my thang on
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
(so the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Now we got up on hittin the cuz
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves
mo' we got up on some bud
Straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone
Smokin delight the body right what the party like
Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky
But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high
cause it feels so good

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Sittin back cruising through the slow breeze
thinkin how can I get mo' cheese
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
I stay on my P's for the po-P's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through
Sit on the floor playin Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin you
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
Bring out the best in you 
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs
and where they been hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy
what you feelin on maybe soft with the silicone baby
but can you pay me?
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll
while rockin dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about
how later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks
Now is that news or not?
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O""
Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro
on billets take a choke on so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life
but the hood life was still a good life
and that we know always and forever though
for ever more rollin in the ghetto with nowhere to go
and it feels so good

(Chorus 3X)",happy,1

Jason Mraz,Did You Get My Message?  (Live From Shubas),"Did you get my message
The one I left while I was trying to condense everything that I meant
In a minute or less when I called to confess and make all of my stresses go bye-bye

Did you get my message
Didn't, I guess, 'cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest instead of beating our breast, making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Uh oh, where did it go
Must have bypassed your phone and flown right outta the window
Oh well, how can I tell
Should I call the operator
Maybe she know the info
But whether or not if my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
Why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back
I'd relax and be relieved of all my panic attacks

Ahh oooh
Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message
No, I didn't hear a word
Did you get my message
Now I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Answer the question
I don't hear a thing from you and you keep saying you're coming
Did you get my message now that I wanna get back with you
Did you get my message, love that I wanna reconnect with you
Did you get my message, sugar now
I did not hear one thing you sent to me
Did you get my message, love
Answer the phone",sad,0

I rip shows don't sleep shorty I'm woke
I been practicin since the age of four
I got my mind right I'm up in the limelight
I guess you hate me when you know that I rhyme tight
Nicer than nice I'm skillful make you think twice
Whats my name Lil' Ro, I'm larger than life
When I'm not pushin a hummer I'm ridin a bike
A Lil' Soulja what they call me I go off on the mic
If a ticket was around my neck it would be covered in ice
And my wrist stay blingin its a lovable site
I'm ragin on all types of stages
You might be nice but see I'm the greatest
Wanna see me take it home from the stages
I'm the one I'm tellin you son like the matrix
Matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix

(Chorus Four: Lil' Romeo, Silkk the Shocker)
Ya'll don't really want to mess with me
Y'all better respect my G.
Better think before you step to me...
Where you from wodie? I'm from the C-P-3
Y'all really down to ride with us
Cross side get wild with us
Get it crunk all the way live with us
From the South to the Eastside with us",sad,0
Seal,The Beginning (Giro E Giro Mix),"The beginning saw existence of a chosen dream
But then came pain
With energy striking on those she knew would uncover her lies
She felt she must destroy everything that we had prayed for
So she sent shameful claim in her lies
She wants us to be what's going on in her mind

Music takes you round and round and round and round and round,
Hold on to the love.
Hold on to the love.
Music takes you round and round and round and round and round,
Hold on to the love.
Nahhh Nah Nah Nah

Hold on to the love
...We are smiling.

She wants us to be what's going on in her mind.
If she is to take over she must prevent unity.
But oh how cold her life must be.
She knows she must destroy everything that we had prayed for.
So here comes shameful claim in her lies.

Music takes you round and round and round and round and round,
Hold on to the love.
Hold on to the love.
Music takes you round and round and round and round and round,
Hold onto the love.

Hold on to the love.
Hold on to the love.

Hold on...
Round and round and round and round and round,

Hold on to the love

Go round, go round but hold on to the love. 
hold on to the love.

Music takes you round and round and round and round and round,
Hold on to the love.

Go round.
Go round.
Hold on to the love 
So hard for me to try and tell you how I feel.

Ah...no no.. no love.
Go round.

Curtis Mayfield,Superfly (Single Mix Version),"Darkest of night
With the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong
Lotta things goin' on

The man of the hour
Has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long

Oh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

Hard to understand
What a hell of a man
This cat of the slum
Had a mind, wasn't dumb

But a weakness was shown
'Cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own
But the man lived alone

Ooh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

The game he plays he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over
That's what he tryin' to do, y'all

Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Wooh, Superfly

The aim of his role
Was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream
What does it mean? He wouldn't know

""Can't be like the rest""
Is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out
And there's no happiness

Ooh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

The boss come in and walks down the aisles
He turns around but he never smiles
He watches me just like a hawk
And then he says we must talk

You move me, from side to side
You move me and if feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around

Son, he says (what) I've got bad news
Life is hard and you got the blues
I know you're good and I know you work hard
I'm sorry, son, but here are your cards
I went home and kicked off my shoes
And I asked myself why do I always lose
But then you called and everything was fine
I'm so glad that you are mine

You move me, from side to side
You move me and if feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around

You're the one thing in my life

Just how small I am and how tall You are
And where I was before, and I say
Why do I, why do I , why do I ever wonder why

When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first!

Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl, 
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him 
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't buy
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

It makes no sense 'cos he will never change

She used to drink in the hills
Only now she drinks in the valleys
Where every road has a name like Beechwood Avenue
Or so it seems
A Croydon girl could really hope to find a home
But with a thousand miles of real estate to choose from
You begin to see the value of your freedom...

The moon is bright in the haze above old Hollywood
And deer look down from the hills
And it's three o'clock in the morning
Pill in hand you can hear his golden surfer boys
Crying out, ""Mummy won't come out of the bathroom!""
And you'd hoped he'd say he's sorry if he hit you
But he's buried in the screenplay of his feature

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in
Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Blue filter lens in a pool of vaseline
But all the rushes look the same
Only there's a movie I wouldn't pay to see again
If it's the one with him in

You and I could be a mile above the earth tremors
Hold to me and we'll climb
You could sneak out while he's sleeping
Suicide in the hills above old Hollywood
Is never gonna change the world
Change the world overnight
Any more than the invention of the six-gun--child--
Any more than the discovery of radium,
Or California tipping in the ocean

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in

Emperor,In the Wordless Chamber,"in the wordless chamber
they feared death
desperately
thus they clustered to the fruits of the earth
craving dispersion
as if to avoid knowing why

in the wordless chamber
they feared life
desperately
thus they proclaimed any given truth
and swallowed
as if to justify their fear

he knew that there had been hordes of seers
before him
who set out to cure
though, the sick wished not to part with
their decease
as if it made them feel
alive

in the wordless chamber
he accepted desperation
and the unpredictable manifestations

Uriah Heep,Ghost of the Ocean (Live),"A ghost of the ocean
Tells of the women of the sea
They ran from opression
In the forgotten history

No innocents
No leaders to defend
No god, no government
And it's hard to believe
They were riders on the sea

Women of fortune
Always to be prepared to die
Blood on a knife edge
Flag of the sea lord flying high

A world of action strong and free
Adventure war and loyalty
The mermaid tyrant loved to fight
She ties the noods and pulls it tight

Treacherous island
Somewhere to hide on no man's land
Ships in the harbour
Waiting to hear the battle plan",sad,0

The Rolling Stones,Fortune Teller,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head 

Siad she'd take a look at my palm
She said ""Son, you feel kinda warm""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love"" 

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes 

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie 

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me 

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
Now I get my fortune told for free 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller

With a leftover finger or two
I took 'em for granted, let 'em all slip away

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

Sometimes I remember sweethearts I've known
Some I've forgotten I suppose
One or two still linger, oh, and I wonder now
Why I ever let them go?

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

So the sidewalk is crowded, the city goes by
And I rush through another day
And a world full of strangers turn their eyes to me
But I just look the other way

Into rivers of purgatory

Soiled with the miasma of the bleakest hemisphere
The formless fires of Amenti unfold
Not nearly as frenzied as discordia that breeds within
Not nearly as frenzied as disorder that I bring

This earth grew weary and dull
Is it the renaissance of my rigid existence?
Is there a future for me beyond the stars?

And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
Start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 

So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe 
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain

Soon I'll be gone and you'll be free,

Phil Collins,I Cannot Believe It's True,"When I opened your letter yesterday
I could not believe my eyes
'Cos I've already given all I have to give
And I think it must have slipped your mind
But I remember not so long ago
I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand
They don't seem to realize
They're listening, but they're not hearing me
They're being too cruel to be kind
Any kind of feeling that I had is gone
'Cos I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna wake up
Over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
'Cos nothing can change all the things that you do to me
Nothing can make me stay

Oh, 'cos you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through
Never meant it to show
It started happening, that's all you know.

Oh, I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up
But over and over I know it's really happening

Finds one boy in back
That she can always stand behind

People look through everything they see
Cuz there's so many other things to be
I have seen you walking in the rain
I wanted to know why you were crying
I wanna fix what's wrong...

It must be love the sailor sails for
Must be love that drives a bottle to the bottom of the ocean floor
Because I imagine all kinds of wonderful water
I would have you there wherever I'll go
Way from the seventh sea,
He brings the bottle back to me
Oh, It Must Be Love
Oh, It Must Be Love
People look through evervthing thev see
There's so many other things to be
I have seen you walking in the rain
I want to know whv vou were crying
Baby, let me fix what's wrong...

It must be love that fathoms the moonlight
Must be love that shallovvs
The deepest part of the night
So you can show them vvith vour eye
The things that make them cry,
Because that Must Be Love

You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
And Rosie you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner waitin' for the bus
Mama she's home in the window waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs 'cause you know we ain't gonna come
I ain't here for business baby, I'm only here for fun 
And Rosie you're the one

Rosalita jump a little lighter, 
Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar, 
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool,
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for

Senorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover ain't no liar, 
Rosalita you're my stone desire

Now I know your mama she don't like me 'cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't...
(...have any money)
Oh, your papa says he knows...
(...that I don't have any money)
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have...
(...any money)
Well, tell him this is last chance
To get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight baby 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'

Told a thousand times before me

It all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when
Your bankroll runs out
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the

Fall down...

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you
When your bankroll runs out

Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the
Show isn't you anymore
Nobody... (Nobody!...)
Nobody

Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become
Sure you hide it 
But you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
(Tell me who's gonna love you? Who? I'd like to know)
Who's gonna love you when
Your bankroll runs out
(If you didn't have nothing)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
(Who, who'd still be there)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, oh)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(There ain't nobody baby)
Fall down...
(I guess your mama never told you what
goes around comes back around)
(Bullies in the schoolyard)
(When they fall they fall hard)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(Yeah... so you)
Fall down
(I guess your mama never told you what
goes around comes back around)
(Better think twice, better play nice)
('Cause who's gonna be there)

Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
(When the jokes on you)
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out
(A marionette show)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
(Who's makin' you move though)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(I know what kills you slow)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(I'm gonna keep your little secret though)
Fall down
(I guess your mama never told you what
goes around comes back around)

Nobody cares when the tears of a clown

Fall down...

Kane,All I Can Do,"May all of your wishes
Come true for life
And all that you wait for
Be true for life
All that you long for
May all of it shine
Bright as the sunlight

And so much for anger
So much for gain
May all that you're after
Be conquered with grace
May all that you reach for
Be worthy and true
And guard you a lifetime

And cry tears of laughter
You will cry tears of pain
But all of that hurting 
And the heartbreaking
It will guide your way
All you've created
May all of it stand
Proudly through ages

And come back again
Come back again

Because I gave you everything I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight
We gotta compromise
Baby, talk to me
And tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me
And let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me
And everything will be alright
But we must communicate
Tomorrow it could be too late

Gang Starr,Mostly Tha Voice (Explicit),"Refrain:

It's mostly tha voice, that gets you up
It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to (chill... chill... )

Up steps one, and he gets done
Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits
You better change your behavior, battling Gangstarr
No religion could save ya
My religion is rap, R-A-P
R-E-A-L-I-T-Y, G
Cause when I rock street kids rejoice
I got mad rhymes, still

Refrain

So when you think you know the whole you don't even know the half
You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats Premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight

Refrain

Some rappers use hooks to this shit
But if you took that shit out
and you took all the music out
What would remain?  The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
when in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
so if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
what about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
Cause I got crazy styles, still

Refrain

Outro: Guru, Shug

Oh shit Shug, whattup

Yo I grew up in Mid-City near World on Wheels
After Reaganomics crack came and more blood spill
I gotta tell shorties now I don't pop pills
The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin to impress you
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family

[Chorus]
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real heads rock real beats
Bangin out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels

[Verse 2]
Peace King, peace haki, peace queen

I only leave em in pieces if they step in the ring
They're fumbling and wondering what weapon to bring
I'm like Ice-T, I know my lethal weapon'll swing
Stop the presses, block the doors
Cops oppress us, watch the wolves
But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents (Rakaa)
Fights for your rights is my pleasure
But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo
I hope the young fly their best yo
Hip-hop desert again, it's like Busy Bee's buzzin again
My patience is thin though
I ventilate em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to the end zone

[Chorus]

When I'm all out, I cause panic (peace summits)
When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)
I made mental notes of who's fam and who frontin
Mental notes of who ran shit and who runnin
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
Create to devastate crew, that's family

And lots of feelings that I can't explain.

But I promise you that you do.

If I had one wish this is what it would be...
I'd ask you to spend all your time with me,
That we'd be together forever.
We'd buy a small house in south central L.A.
Raise lots of kids then we'd both join a gang
Just as long as we're together.

The things you make me wanna do
I'd rob a quik-e mart for you
I'd go to the pound and let all the cats go free
Just as long as you'd be with me.

I won't spend another night alone.
I won't spend another night alone.

Dropkick Murphys,Going Strong (Album Version),"There's a brand new century about to begin and the kids
Of the 90's are paving' the path, for the youth of America,
Free at last from the violence and destruction that destroyed our name,
Whenever there was trouble we took the blame.
But now our scene's alive with a new generation of American kids.

[Chorus:]
We work hard now lets enjoy the fruits of what we've done, tomorrow may never come.
The kids on the street will have their say now - Because!

We've had enough of these negative comparisons a new breed of kids.
Brought together by a movement and a sense of tradition the strong will survive.
And together our backs can never be broken cause now our scene's alive
With a new generation of American kids.

Belle and Sebastian,I Could Be Dreaming,"I could be sleeping
I could be dreaming
I could have ordinary people chasing me from town to town
Mission Impossible
They've got a spy for every blink of your eye

I'm feeling awkward
I'm feeling tongue-tied
They've got a knife for every time you take the same train into work
A family's like a loaded gun
You point it in the wrong direction someone's gonna get killed

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

Is he your husband?
Or just your boyfriend?
Is he the moron who's been beating you and keeping you inside?
I've never done this kind of thing
But if I kill him now, well who's going to miss him?

I went up to the school
I took a walk up Castlehill
For every step there was a local boy who wants to be a hero
Do you wanna do it now?
Outside the butcher's with a knife and a bike chain

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things?

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things?

While your head is clear
While your head is clear
While your head is clear
While your head is clear

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary...""",happy,1

You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, kill off the hours
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, find you a lover
Go away somewhere all bright and new

Who compares with you

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
You deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by and by

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your trouble and worry
You belong somewhere you feel free

Annie Lennox,A Whiter Shade Of Pale,"We skipped the light Fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
AThat a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale

Turned a whiter shade of pale

Mase,Wanna Hurt Mase? (Album Version),"[1] - Do you really wanna hurt Mase? 
Or do you really wanna make me cry? 
Or is it really that you envy Mase?
Or you don't really wanna see me fly? 

Do you really wanna hurt Mase? 
Or do you really wanna make me cry? 
Or is it really that you envy Mase?
Or you don't really wanna see me fly? 

Now you don't wanna see me angry
Ain't enough cops or cuffs to chain me
Days to arraign me, KKK's to hang me, insane me
Ya need ice picks to bang me
Need more than a straight jacket to restrain me
Or more guns with my prints for you to frame me and mame me
Nigga, look at you and look at us
My duns don't fuss, Harlem win you with a thrush
Nigga you better hush, I can mess out the cave 
Niggas still get touched
And them little ones you bust ain't enough for us
Listen here, Mase'll make you disappear
And yo' mouth'll be the reason that you missed this year
Man who needs ya? You don't need me, I don't need you neither
That's why my next Lex gon' be a two seater
And the things I do to you won't leave you beautiful
And though yo' feelin' fuck me, I'm feelin' mutual 

[Repeat 1]

From the M to the A nigga dollar sign E
Come around money if you ever tryin' to find me
I was murder for six years, seen no clean from it
Drop murder off, Mase woke up at Teen Summit
My niggas joke, niggas broke, kill a laugh
I got power, make a call, get a mil' in cash
Like my money and ya ain't cuz they don't tax me
Actually, anything you got to ask me, fax me
I'm no Beamer dreamer, I'm a Bentley man
Car totally smashed threw out 50 grand
How ya figure ya bigger when Mase that nigga
And every style I deliver come with much charisma
Knock it off, now will ya , I'm the one that bitches live for
Don't get me wrong you niggas make it hot I make it sizzler
And I don't know you cats, so don't you get familiar
And if you violate me and mine I guarentee I peel ya

[Repeat 1]

If I ever whisper on a remix, I got C-chips
Time is money, when you talk gotta be quick
I don't see how ya'll hang or even be wit
Niggas ridin' in the Benz with only one V-6
But I know how it is when ya go into the bar
Got girls overreact, they thowin' you a star 
Got niggas player hatin' don't even know who you are
And go as far as leavin' bullet holes in yo' car
When you're from Harlem World niggas never see yo' views
They wait for you to flop or be on BET News
All they see the G's and jewels, V's that ya cruise
Being the underdogs, they can't wait to see us lose
Don't hate me, thank me
I don't get mad when nigga's bitches prank me
Make you cranky to see me places that you can't be
I'm too pretty to let you niggas shank me 
And frankly, know you probably hate me cause you ain't me

Dimmu Borgir,The Chosen Legacy,"Hence I will annoint
And whisper wholeheartedly
The creed of Hades and beyond
As I succumb to inevitable sin

For I cannot enslave myself
With imaginary words of salvation
The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple
Is assisted by pretenders to the throne

The winds that blow purity
Signify my chosen legacy
I was born to opposition
A contender to creation

In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli

For my sins
I will ask no forgiveness
For my sins
They are not to forgive

So never speak of me quietly
Stand by my confession
I voice your rebellion
Against the traitor of the world

I am the first creature of this kingdom
I will be the one
To out live his time
With the triumph of free will",sad,0

Will they be the next one found?

Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 
Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes, 
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 

In the crowded sheds the children lay their heads 
To escape the Haitian heat 
The hunger pains drive them to the street 
Wond'ring if today they'll eat 
Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease 
Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease. 

The least of these is hungry. 
The least of these is sick. 
The least of these needs clothing. 
The least of these needs drink. 
The least of these knows sorrow. 
The least of these knows grief. 
The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.

Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggaz I'ma die tryin for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turnin back my nigga cause we takin it there

I be the deacon I'm beatin niggaz and speakin the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggaz be seekin me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step.. for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus
While a lot of other niggaz don't be tellin you nothin
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggaz trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggaz from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggaz to my live niggaz everywhere

Bob Dylan,Trying To Get To Heaven,"The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what  even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before
I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door",sad,0

Than push my limbs out towards you right there 
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes 
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies 

I struggle for the words and then give up 
My head's up with the birds on the T hut 
A little peace of mind that I know better 
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters 

But after that the floodgates opened up 
And I fell in love with everyone I saw 
Please take your time, I'm not in any rush 
And it's in everything I ever write 

It's not as if I need the extra weight 
Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot 
Lonely written words for company 
Just raise the roof this once and follow me

So sick of cheap excuses from everyone I know I'm scattering the ashes of who I was.

Julie Roberts,The Chance,"I found a book that my mama kept
Filled with secrets she hid
And in a dusty old attic, one mornin I read
About a woman I never met
Who had dreams just like mine
With every page that I turned, the words came alive

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

A tear fell on that faded page
Cause this was somebody else
Not the mama I knew who never thought of herself
But the times, they were different then
And lines just didn't get crossed
And these words that she wrote, they somehow got lost

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

The chance that she never had
Is now the gift that is mine
And out here on this road, I'm makin up for lost time
Yeah, I am my mother's child
And tonight in this car
I've got her words in my suitcase and her dreams in my heart

As I roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
While I still have the chance
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
While I still have the chance",happy,1
Natalie Cole,The Gift,"Written by mark davis & marti sharron

Every captain must steer the wheel, not by choice but from the voice

That's in his ear, I have lived long and I've done much wrong

But I've survived through my lies, I'm still here, so all you people

Know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you, I have lived on

Yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me

Well I felt fire and I got tired of running from the truth



And I let people down, and I wore a crown of being the biggest fool

So all you people know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you

I have lived on, yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me

There were times I had enough, I almost gave it up

But you reached out your heart to me, look what you've done now

I've become the best, oh, I'm the best I can be, oh, oh, oh

You've returned your love, the gift of love, yes, you gave this gift to me",happy,1

Amorphis,Misery Path (From the Privilege of Evil),"We sail across the sea,
In our thoughts we float over mountains
All this vanity that we could hide

and to live your life in fear by hate
and create our own gods

We all ourselves are created
our own images
Ourselves we are created
our own gods

When the sun is rising,
When the whole sky is red like blood
Man can realize the real meaning of life
to love and respect your life

Conspiring with the reef
To sink our ship

The wind's a cheating wife
Her tongue a thirsty knife
And she could take your life
With one good kiss

As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea

I know the ocean speaks (The stars retreat behind their veil)
I've heard her call to me (The clouds are clinging to your sail)
And smiling in my dreams (The storm is coming, can you see?)
She whispers this:

""Can you see the sky turn red
As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea""

Look and see the sky turn red
Like blood it covers over me
And soon the sea shall give up her dead

Of cheap wine and bad decisions

And all those who seek it shall find it
A pardon for all who believe
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind

To all who've been born in the Spirit
And who share incarnation with Him
Who belong to eternity stranded in time
And weary of struggling with sin

Forget not the hope that's before you
And never stop counting the cost
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost

Coldplay,Speed Of Sound (Live),"How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I going to stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand",sad,0

George Huff,Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (LP Version),"Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Let your heart be light,
From now on our troubles
Will be out of sight.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away.

Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore,
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow,
Hang a shining star
On the highest bough,
And have yourself
A merry little Christmas now",happy,1
The Smashing Pumpkins,Real Love,"Fall in to the century of supersonic cross
Blessed she in aching silence- eternal loss
Calling out ""I won't surrender""
A locket of her hair
Sympathize her pious pleasures
Go down the stairs into the dark again
To feel alive again, and wait for
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time?
Because it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Real love
Born of the ball and chain
Into a world sustained with sorrow
Real love
A real touch we speak in
Is it lies.
Or is what we're seeking
Real love
In the eyes
Behold and you'll find the 21st century
Detonate her will and her widowed speech
Buried in the backyard shadow
The rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a
Nameless dream
Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tommorow
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love
Or just yours to treasure
Real love
Real love
Real love
We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell her of my fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless
Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity
Real Love",happy,1
Rihanna,We Ride,"Ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride

Oceansize,New Pin (edit),"In goodness wake I'll always say I do
That it's all for you
And tricks I'd turn would always shine right through
But it's all for you

Like a stream overflowing
Unpredictable
A new confidence like a new king
Like a breeze levitating
To raise a sunken soul
And to the surface shines like a new pin

What junkie says is not what junkie do
But it's all for you
And the tricks he turns will always shine right through
But it's all for you

Like a dream synchronising
With the one I missed the most
A concentrated love from a new queen
Like a wave stabilising
I walk a tighter rope
And my new victim shines like a new pin
I can feel lies within the
Gospels that I'm sold
The tactless sentiments are a new pain

But it's all for you",sad,0
Blackalicious,World Of Vibrations (Album Version),"(feat. Ledisi) 

[Gift of Gab] 
We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations 
Introduction to the nation of revolutionary thoughts 
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and change 
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter 
So y'all niggaz still ego trip based and 
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss 
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the stages 
Play this on your play list 
I like dough 
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical 
And don't blame me for the slang and the words 
God writes these rhymes through me 
I just listen to him 
I'm just livin' duke 
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me 
Cuz I still think abstract 
And stay metaphysical 
And challenge what is really real 
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back 
Not that it's away 
But everybody got somethin' to say 
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now 
And make that hot 
So it will get exploited 
And the corporation only will back dudes who bite my style 
And they can try and try again 
I've been influenced by a lot of pioneers 
South to the East and West 
But when a hot MC 
Gets on stage with a real MC 
Most of the time the situation gets hostile 

[Chorus: Ledisi] 
We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Welcome to our world and intro to 
Fall into a space 
Where there is no thoughts 
Just moments captured 
Here we go 

We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Let us up inside your head 
Just step inside our world of vibration 
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed 

[Gift of Gab] 
Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within 
In a world of BS that we're livin' in 
To my ears music sound sweet as cinnamon 
So I stay poundin' out tunes and tunes again and again 
In the 5th chapter ladies and gentlemen 
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu 
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though 
On second thought, I'm like a letter man though 
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome 
Shootin' through your vains, vibratin' though your eardrums 
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes 
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum 
Seen the world two times all except for India 
About to vacate there when we finish this one 
Work hard but still some sweep 
We won't mention them 
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine 
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin' 
When we're done with this these songs are our pension 
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson 
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen 
City, town, state arena or convention 
Please believe these the G's that ease pension 
Rakka and Ev said that it's a marathon 
Song after song, we keep on inventin' 

[Chorus] - repeats",happy,1

Crawled back to the shore instead

many days you have lingered around my cabin door

there are frail ones fainting at the door
though their voices are silent

David Phelps,One King (Album Version),"In the beginning there was the Word
Pure love was spoken to reach every man
They stopped and listened but all that they heard
Was language that they could not understand
No joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He left behind His throne of pure light
Gave up His crown that we might be free
He chose a manger that Bethlehem night
And reaching through time and space He saw me
With no joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He could have chosen to break through the sky
With anthem and angel wing
But He knew we'd understand a baby's cry
And learn love from a servant King

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been so many babies to become a king
Only one King, one King became a baby",sad,0

And the flowers cover the land
Theyve been waiting patiently
For the right raindrop to set 'em free
Well aint it just like love
I thought there was none
That was when I found one
On a dark night in a southern town
You called to me and I turned around
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned
You couldnt have come at a better time
And every day in my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Lucky that we did not meet
Ten years back on the street
So many pages yet to turn
So many dreams still to burn
Oh but I dont cry for the wasted years
Or the twisted roads that got me here
I have been to the end of the earth
And I know what standing still is worth
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned
Love dont travel in straight lines
And every day of my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Well the wheel of fortune is going round and round
I never thought I would come up when I was down

But a perfect moment when the stars aligned
When you put your hand in mine
And every day of my life has led me to
That perfect moment
Every day of my life has led me to
This perfect moment with you",happy,1

Michael Card,Arise_ My Love (Song Of Solomon),"Arise, my love, my lovely one, come
The winter is past, and the rains are gone
The flowers appear, it's the season of song
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

Who is it that appears like the dawn?
As fair as the moon, as bright as the sun?
Show me your face, let me hear your voice
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

Set me like a seal on your heart
For love is unyielding as the grave
The flash of it is a jealous fire no flood can quench
For love is as strong as death

Arise, my love, and come with me
Before the dawn breaks and the shadows flee
You ravished my heart with just one glance
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

Set me like a seal on your heart
For love is unyielding as the grave
The flash of it is a jealous fire no flood can quench
For love is as strong as death

Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires

Arise, my love, my lovely one, come
The winter is past and the rains are gone
The flowers appear, it's the season of song
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

I am my love's, my beloved is mine

Rachael Starr,Till There Was You (John Creamer & Stephane K Remix),"What can I do?

I want you addicted to me..

What in the world is a girl to do?
When in this smokey place I only see you
Was far away when you caught my eye
You've brought me back and now you're making me high

I was alone out there, with no one else around
Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down

Till there was you, I know what you're needing
My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes
What can I do? I'm looking right at you
This feeling is all new, I want you addicted to me

Fate can act in a curious way
When all that mattered means nothing today
All that concerns me, that drenches my thoughts
Is the sensation that seeing you brought

I was alone out there, with no one else around
Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down

And there's no coming down..

Till there was you.. What can I do..?

The Gathering,Gaya's Dream,"(Infatuated by the extensiveness of the universe, it's easy to forget one of the most complex enigmas of this world: The human mind, a universe of it's own.)

Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Centuries through mankind's eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

Slowly walking, pacing front
See through these blind eyes
Stepping on shadows, touching air
Stones move as I stand still
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

For years of space technology
Still we haven't learned
Like children we explore
Things we can't yet comprehend

Open the doors of the past
With the beating of a heart
Dream as the years go by
Carrying our own cross
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes",sad,0
Jefferson Starship,Fading Lady Light,"I've had desert visions
When the moon is shining bright
The end of the rainbow promise
Almost in my sight
Sat with my back against cold stone
Waiting for the morning light
And all the things I've seen in dreams
Have kept me up all night
Always reaching to the sky
Soft hard stone
I'm sitting here and thinking
Bout all the centuries its known
Got a feeling someone's near
Listening to the East wind moan
You know there's no one here
But I just don't feel alone

Fading Lady Light
Always here with me
Singing your song in the wind at night
You know I've never felt so free
You're my reality
Don't you fade away from me
The wind it paints your face
As it stirs the shifting sand
Nightmare creatures closing in
They leave at your command
If only you were beside me now
Maybe I would understand
And I could leave my dreams for life
To live the dream we planned

Eazy-E,I'mma Break It Down,"[Eazy-E]
My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
takin' out profanity so they can play it though
listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
going to the record store say ya gonna buy
that the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
so that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits 
takin' my time of each line to make sure it fits
push play on the instrumental thats recorded
step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
some sort of track appeared like a plaque
and some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
takin' a bow cause I got style
never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short 
guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
so get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds so quit playin' around
cause I'mma break it down

[Eazy-E]
Last time I was takin' my time with this
but other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
but they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
ready to go, like never before
givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine
and I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
and I think I'm gonna rock then
you got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
to freeze after I'll cut ya cause I'mma butcher
and say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
like a said before ya get rubbed in the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
M.C. Ren: ""But ya the dopest one I ever saw!"" 
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
and when I'm on the mic I always throw down
to keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
so listen cause I'mma break it down

[Eazy-E]
Now look at me and not the poster
and you could see right off I got the most of
the talent, experience or a trade 
and complements for the rhyme thats made
talks over today if this one so
pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
cause I don't need water to clear my throat
comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
wantin' to get wit me this routine 
keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
can ya dis this man I don't think so
once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
comin' out with songs like hit after hit
cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
makin' it sound so dope cause I'm a genius
but your amazed with ya happy to see this
brother go crazy on wax
flowin' away like if I was on a sax
doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight
relax and chill while your up tight
pumpin' up the funky sounds

Heaven 17,Come Live With Me (12'' Extended Version) (2006 Digital Remaster),"I was thirty-seven
You were seventeen
You were half my age
The youth I'd never seen
Unlikely people meeting in a dream
Heaven only knows the way it should have been 

Here today my tomorrow
Where you lead I will follow
All that kissing
No passion missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Dinner parties followed
And all my age implies
My friends began to talk
I began to realise
If half the things they say
Are quarter true of me
Then how can I eclipse the youth
You gave to set me free 

There was something in your smile
That was hard to reconcile
The time had come to testify to reason
Though years will not erase
Remembrance of those days
At least there's no submission to hearts treason 

Here today my tomorrow
No more shame only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Now there's nothing left to cry for
And there's nowhere left to go
Just another hopeless fight
But how were we to know
The strong are sometimes wrong
But the weak are never free
The choice we made we can't evade
Don't try to follow me 

Here today my tomorrow
No more pain only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me

Just woke up the wanting in me
Wishing I'd never met her knowing if I'd forget her
How much better off she would be
The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
The harder that it's gonna be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
I've never deserved her God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries but she can't tell how she feels but I know
Too well what she's going through
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Last night I told her this time it's all over making
Ten times I've told her goodbye
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
And it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning 
Just woke up the wanting in me",sad,0

Fake Problems,Tabernacle Song,"We've almost got job security,

And warm plates of food
Waiting to be had.

What you can give.
I can honestly say
At this point in my life,
I'm grateful for what I get.

So hey,
Why am I trying to escape,
When everything I need is right here
At home?

I read that every good sermon
It starts with a story
To reel the audience in.
But I've got no life experience,
Just this terrible fear
That I'll captivate anything.
If I really have your attention
I'm desperate for the affection
Of a full capacity room.
As sweat seeps from my pores
I race for the door
And don't want it anymore.

So hey,
Why am I trying to escape,
When everything I need is right here?

You didn't make it that far.
They saw ya picking flowers 
From their yard.
Well hip, hip, hooray
What a wonderful escape.
And the way that I see
I see nothing at all,
I'm blindfolded in the backseat
Of a car.
Just drop me somewhere,
I can't retrace my steps.

Can I come back yet
To the only place
That clears my head?

Elvenking,Trows Kind,"(Music / Lyrics: Aydan)

Concealed from the view
Hidden from the knowledge of Men
A little kind through trees it lives
Nymphs of dark and lust
""Fairy of bad fate!""
Somebody tells he has seen
Some of the little ones
Some even that have talked with them
So nice and handsome
""Please, don't be such a fool!
Tell everyone that the witches come tonight""

(Bridge:)
Desire grows, denial howls
Your will has gone
""Divine the wicked multitude
Worship your servitude""
Enthroned and ringed with gold
Of the mighty old oak
I'm on the lightness side

(Chorus:)
Daughters and sons
There are times to carry on,
All my life for you
Keep on singing my tale
Deny the Trows kind
Don't you dare to stay behind?
Through years and centuries,
Through myth and poetry
Our race's slowly dying
In the heart of mankind

Deep in the woods
They're dressed with the fruits of earth
Arcane adorers of the roots
Dance Henking tonight
""Fairy of bad fate!""
Vanishing through branches
Followeed by the Redcaps
Theyre greddy for silver and gold

(Bridge and chorus)

Trapped in a web of branches and leaves dead
You hear voices reciting a prayer...
Come nearer and see!

I know it can't be over 'cause I still wake up reaching for you in the night

I'm listening to the talking should I pick up the phone

Follow again one single piece
of dream afar
Spent my all whole life there,
chasing the hope

A drive so strong,
so deep I cannot see the end
Inborn sense of finding
what's beyond, in the furious storm

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind

Watch my gold,
it can be never bought or sold
Made up and collected through the years
from emotions and dreams

A noble line I carry on 
Exploring the ways I never saw

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind

[Solo: Aydan]
[Melody: Jarpen / Regality: both]

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind
If you were given chance to fly would you
retain your tears of joy
Pushed as far as any wind will go,
a fiery stride to the sun

Clearing my path from anything
that leads me to a fall
On the brink of loneliness, I faced 
the illusion of leaving from the flock
On this one way trail to unfolding new
worlds",happy,1
Fernando Ortega,Don't Let Me Come Home A Stranger (LP Version),"As I walked out one evening
To breathe the air and soothe my mind,
I thought of friends and the home I had,
And all those things I left behind.

A silent star shone on me,
My eyes saw a far horizon,
As if to pierce this veil of time,
And escape this earthly prison.

Will there come a time when the memories fade.
and pass on with the long, long years,
When the ties no longer bind?
Lord save me from this darkest fear.
Don't let me come home a stranger,
I couldn't stand to be a stranger.",sad,0
Amorphis,Into Hiding,"The islander slips into hiding
And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds

There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows",sad,0
Tammy Wynette,I Stayed Long Enough,"Accident'ly in your arms and that's all it took
Knowing how you want and need me with just one look
To leave you now is something you should know that I can't do

Long enough to know that what I feel won't go away
Just lookin' won't be near enough after today
Everything I need is everything I see in you
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you

Double-cross your heart, and don't even try.

Daniel Johnston,High Horse,"I was thinking about your love
You was only hiding, like the lord above
Looking down like an angel, upon my lonely life
And no matter the angle, I want you to be my wife

I was dreaming, you understood
You were thinking, you wished you would
Looking down form your high horse
Like I didn't matter, of course

What they say at the funeral, it darkens and remorse
You were thinking I was sleeping in my thoughts
So lonely my tears fall down my brain
Rode my train for a cheap price, baby it's no surprise

Looking down from your high horse
Listening to my lullaby
I was thinking, that the world of sin
A sinking feeling, like I'm falling in love again

Looking down from your high horses
Like I didn't matter, of course
Say hello at my funeral
I'll be right there on time

You could only be my love, love, love",sad,0

Obscured by light, a stain inside

Painted ponies in this one horse town
Are getting old

Naughty By Nature,Family Tree,"Sometimes because of jealousy and the intent to demise
Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere

Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom
Dreamin' 'bout my own ending

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

And meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourne you 'til I join you

Uhh and now I know I got some family
Who missed me from the heart, forever we're apart
Just because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me
Now you wanna try to come bruise me

And even though maybe were in there
Farther than it once was I know family don't always
Mean that they blood 'cause some people just
Don't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name

So all the fat we had to cut and I'm still
Walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage
And now I know who's butt

So when I sent you tried to play me
All of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart
Never trust you from the start

Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way
And if we never speak again, it's got to be that way
This millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny
Remind thee naughty invented family of the 90's

So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Life doesn't end when the sweat dries
A time when a nickle cost a dollar
When you rise your chest dies
My dynasty many fear it cos' I'm near it

Ancient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hyroglyphics
Motherfuckers try to touch my mental state
Niggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate
So it seems nowadays that the only plan

To get my people help my people get a load of land
And Im'ma see it if I have to kill some shit
To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness
See a black man standin' on the promised land

Since they broke every promise I devised a plan this
Black this and black that crap is gettin' touchy
Any black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky
Those who turn. they back with they fears

And try to before they can see us
They gonna need us sweet Jesus

Novembre,Reason,"(C. Orlando, Pagliuso, G. Orlando)

Upon the rivers of the day
It blows a cool breeze in the air
Of thoughts and shimmering hours of May
And all its feelings

I dared to walk down by the lane
Calm and fearless in the rain
I felt that you were by my side
Calm and tender

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Is warm and fills me with its rays

Listen, all the time we witness miracles,
All the time!

We thought that anyone that has a life
Bear the cross of the passion and of the time
Oh, the way I was blind!

The time I stumbled over your blue eyes
I felt like falling into a pool of joy
And a sort of miracle happened
The ancient fortress vanished at your smile

You are the reason for this May

So now it's time to spread it around

I believe in the good vibration

I believe that there's magic up our sleeves
So now it's time to spread it around

Round and round and round and around and around
We gotta spread it
Around and round and round and around and around...

In the beat of a drum, you could dance 'til the sun

Just don't know, don't know where I've been

Can't even find a friend
Woah, my love, my love she's not waiting
Think I might've been gone, I've been gone too long
People make me crazy
I can hardly sing my song
Hustlers stand around me, 
I'm lost and all alone
Can't tell the bad from the good
I'm lost ins the woods, I'm lost in the woods
Big city gamblers, gamblers take my money
Yes it gets to be useless, yes it's useless to me
And I think I'm lost, when I'm lost inside this jungle
Can't see the forest for the tress
Well pretty little woman come and get me
Try me, try me one more time
Yes and your sweet, your sweet understanding
Cant' fix this broken heart of mine
The vultures fly around, come and take me home
Can't tell the bad from the good
I'm out in the woods, I'm lost in the woods
I'm a man gone crazy in the woods
I'm wandering around the bush",sad,0
Pearl Jam,You Are,"This broken wheel is coming undone
And the road's exploding
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you

Love is a tower
And you're the key
Leading me higher
When you let me in

Keeping us close, so close
On down the line
Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun
With no one knowing
But you're keeping me strong
Moving along with you

You are a tower of
Strength to me
The darkening hour
Sees light again

Shai Hulud,We Who Finish Last,"We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
Be content to light your own path
And burn what you have crossed
The bridges were frail
The people, pretended

Storm forth with the light of the inflamed
Reclaim and ignite the sky
Brightly to blind
Rip off the veneers enabling opportunists to thrive
Dam the rise of grime and rats

More sickening than a social circle that believes itself charmed
Are the writhing droves of blowhards and yes men
Clamoring to slither in
Stay sovereign on the outside

We are who finished last
The unaffected
Contrasting the wide and white
We are who finish last
Sound
Indignant
The iron to gleaming teeth
The salt on saccharin
We who finish last
Proudly in their darkness
Lit from within

Glad hands grabbing for brass rings
Painting their bricks gold
Keen sycophants filthy scheming
Furthering the feuds of their adored
They have picked their enemies impeccably
Very keen indeed

And so siege the scorned

We are naught but beds of thorns and dark horses
Unwelcome guests who will just not mind their place
A single musket ball to pierce and lodge inside
And lead the circle to crack

We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
No genuine light to be found
Only rays of cold, synthetic beams on a mock aristocracy
so the vain and insecure can feel revered and cared for
For a cheap, fleeting moment
Truly noble

Storm forth with the light
We who finish last
Proudly in our darkness
Lit from within

Conflict in the chest
To be concerned for the needs of such heartless men",sad,0

Am I so insignificant?

Suicidal Tendencies,Monopoly On Sorrow,"There's a cold wind in the winter of my mind
A season that last through all changes in time
I try so hard sometimes
I wish there was a raincheck on tommorow
Not ready to deal with what I don't wanna find

Struggling on, just to hold on
I just wanna know, why is it me?

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's hope gone astray
I cry so hard sometimes
Too scared to think what will bring tommorow
Already much more than I can handle today

I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate
And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate
I just wanna know why is it me?
Losing the race with thoughts out of place
I just wanna, know why is it me?

You aint got a monopoly on sorrow
You know plenty has made it my way
You aint got a monopoly on sorrow
There's plenty that feel just the same

There's a pain so insane that I fight but can't tame
And my mind battles on as my body lies lame

I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
Hurts, hurts
And I know that I know I don't know that I know
It just would stay clear then I'd see and I'd go
I just wanna know why it's me

So put a little on the back of someone else
'Cause another problem just to ease yourself
Can't you see that it's coming back around, and when it comes back
It'll drive you farther down
It'll drive you farther down...

Is it life that holds us down?

Can you fly without your wings on board?
It seems pretty unfair to end up on the floor
Paying for a crime you weren't charged for 
Alive in a world that always wants more
Is it any wonder that you're falling back
Inside the pattern that defines all you lack?
Don't you want to get into your car and get out of this town?
Get out of this town?

Ever since you said goodbye

I call out your name 

Every time it rains 
I hang my head and want to die 
I don't seem to care that I'm 
Just not making it on my own 
Every time it rains 

Sometimes late at night 
I close my eyes 
And pretend that you're here with me 
Every time it rains 
I realize just how lonely my life is gonna be 

Every time it rains 
Every time I hear the raindrops fall 
I may say I don't mind it at all

That in time I'll find somebody else

Kiss,Every Time I Look At You,"Tried to say I'm sorry
I didn't mean to break your heart

And every time I hold you
The things I never told you
Seem to come easily
'Cause you're everything to me, yeah

I never really wanted
To let you get inside my heart
I wanted to believe this would soon be ending

I thought it wouldn't matter
If it all just came apart
But now I realize I was just pretending

Ooh baby, I know I hurt you
But you can still believe in me

No matter what I'm goin' through
It's easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you
Seem to come easily,

It's gonna take a little time to show you
Just what you mean to me, oh yeah

Not in an ordinary way
All at once the song I heard
No longer would it play

For anybody
Or anyone
That needed comfort from somebody
Needed comfort from someone

Who cared
To be
Not like you
And unlike me

And then the voices went away
From me
Somehow you set the wheels in motion
That haunt our memories

You were the instrument
You were the one
How a body took a body
You gave that boy a gun

You took our innocence
Behind our stares
Sometime the only thing
We counted on when no one else was there

His only friends are silence and the gloom
I don't know where he dues till to his faith????????
I only pray for him to find the strength
The strength he needs for his survival
To make it to this day's arrival

They'll be singing till the night comes to an end

Missy Higgins,The Special Two (Australian Version),"I've hardly been outside my room in days,
'Cos I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cos we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cos we're the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cos we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cos we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cos we're the special two.

I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.
And we could only see each other we'd bleed together,
These arms would not be taught to need another's
'Cos we're the special two.",sad,0
Dropkick Murphys,The Only Road (Album Version),"How could you choose a path without knowing 
where you'd end up
Where you came from was a time and
place that you had never been

(Is this the only road)

Can you fake your way through conversation 
or just simply turn away
Set a course for the desert sun 

Is this the only choice
To live without a choice,
this is the only choice we'll know

Cut your teeth and now it's time to show the world that what your made of
Was a travesty that many just call luck

(Is this the only road)

Now climb aboard the red line train that's headed out of town
Or stick around and just relive your past

Is this the only choice
To live without a choice,
this is the only choice we'll know

You're always running out of wind and you keep saying it's the end
You're always hoping that you'll win,
but then you throw in the towel in",sad,0
Carpenters,An Old Fashioned Christmas,"How I miss that old-fashioned Christmas
Carols being sung by the tree
Window's candlelight shining bright
For the whole world to see

Children's eyes of sweet expectations
Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient
On long Christmas Eves of old

It used to be that all the family
Would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling
Shared together knowing
Christmas was here
One night a year

How I miss that old-fashioned Christmas
Memories that last through the years
Call me sentimental, don't mind if you do
I wish an old fashioned Christmas to you",sad,0
Sick Of It All,Consume (LP Version),"No use ignoring me, I represent the darkest thing you feel. 
No use avoiding me, I'm woven in the fabric of your being. 
Don't back away from me, I feed on apprehension and fear. 
Don't back away from me, don't blind yourself to what you really should be seeing. 

A part of you that will consume if given the chance to, 
A part of you that will abuse whenever allowed to. 
A part of you that will consume if given the chance to, 
A part of you that wants to see you loose it all. 

C'mon, see what you get. 
C'mon, when will you 
Come to terms with what's inside,
Come to terms with what you try to hide.

Emotion overload, might really mean the end of the road. 
Emotion overload, might mean the end of everything you know.
Emotional check, just might reveal emotional wreck. 
Emotional check, just might reveal your weakness 'cause you've finished.",sad,0
3 Doors Down,Be Like That,"He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
And then he lies awake and he wonders
""Why can't that be me?""

'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things he'd rather not mention right now
Just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do?
What would I do? Yeah

She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed, on a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold on to
That's all she needs, yeah

The White Stripes,A Martyr For My Love For You,"She was sixteen and six feet tall,
In a crowd of teenagers coming out of the zoo.
She stumbled, started to slip and fall,
Teeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoes.
I happened to catch her and said,
""Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you.""
Maybe for you, now.

But not as shaky as I must have seemed,
Talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream.
And on the phone I could not compete,
My dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak.
For a sec', I thought I sounded sweet,
But sure enough in a gruff, faint voice,
I heard myself speak.

And I can tell a joke, but one of these days, I'm bound to choke.
And we could share a kiss, but I feel like I can't go through with this.
And I bet we could build a home, but I know the right thing for me to do...
Is to leave you alone.
Leave you alone, now.

I'm beginning to like you, so you probably won't get what I'm going to do.
I'm walkin' away from you, it probably don't make much sense to you.
But I'm trying to save you from all of the things that I'll probably say or do.

I let the whole world know that I can't be stopped,
Even without Doc I'm still from the (Streets of Compton),
Yeah nigga I said it, and I'ma stay on top,
Like a hoodrat with bomb ass cock,
Run up in 'em like these rap niggas, I ain't gotta clap niggaz,
End your career with one line like that niggaz,
Hit the switch front and back, make it bounce,
Let it jump, Killa-for-ni-a is where I'm from,
3 wheelin' with the ass out, smoke chronic 'til I pass out,
All the way to my nigga Daz house,
He always gotta big bad bitch from Long Beach,
She a known freak and she gotta long reach,
She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it, never back down,
'specially when Al Green in the background,
Now bitch hit the weed and turn that ass round,
It's time to bring back Chronic into Doggystyle,
Westcoast niggaz still holdin' shit down,

I'm back on the cover of the Source and the XXL,
Floatin' all through the (Streets of Compton),
I got more bitches, more plaques, more beef, and more straps,
That's what the fuck I call ""Gangsta rap"",
I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turn enemies,
Streets kept me laced like bloods dipped in hennesse,
You niggaz act like the Game can't roll 'em out,
One man show still sell a motherfucker out,
We know Dre still sell a motherfucker out,
'cus everybody here from the (Streets of Compton),
We got crip niggaz, blood niggaz, assays, asians,
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces,
I kept you niggaz waiting had to take you back to the basics,
Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Daitons,
Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbating,
I run though hoes like Walter Payton on the daily,
I got your main bitch swallowing my babies,

I'm the Westcoast Rakim, got you niggaz blocked in,
Glass house parked sideways on the stock rims,
New school, old school mentality,
Translation - Four pumps and twelve batteries,
Hydraulics make the world go round,
Your girl go down, chronic make your girl slow down,
For she end up like superhead, giving superhead,
Every nigga in the industry now fuck superhead,
And I might just fuck her too,
If I ever catch her sliding or riding through the (Streets of Compton),
Rolling down Green Leaf smoking on that green leaf,
With a Mac 10 like I was born on Queen's Street,
Murder MCs like I was born in Queen's Bridge,
That how I show you palm niggas where the King is,
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock,
I'm in the Hall Of Fame next to Snoop, behind 'Pac,
I got the whole motherfucking world locked,

(Chorus: (The Game)

I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,
It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop niggas)

In the world of fear

When you comb your hair
And you're unaware
And your friends all say that you're looking great
Those black and white movies apply

Since you're in love

And in another year well I won't be here

Every time that I look at you boy, I can see your a nervous wreck,
You try to hard to give her every little thing,
Big car, big pool, big house heart attack,
You better bend, or your gonna break

How far does it take you,

Blood feenin', the villain like 'Wassup ya'll'
Deep down schemin' how to kill 'em
Misleadin' a bit, although proceedin' a hit
I made 'em feel I'd never jeopardise my freedom for shit
Played the empty headed part, 
Though the moment they dreaded start, neat
Back of the head and took the credit card
Seen properly decease,
Made it look like an everyday robbery to police
And I's out
Police believed a thief pop for sureity, a jerky
Alert the rest to beef up security
And not to get flashy, although another blast occurred
Another brother deservin' to get massacred
Pleasure in poppin' that flea
Should a heard mister tough guy coppin' mad pleas
Not insane, nor am I biased
Though feels good to watch a motherfucker die before 
my fly ass
Ain't nuttin' to blast, fuck it
Then I put some crack vials in the ass pocket and was off
Police said a thug awaited, since I didn't leave no evidence
A drug related incident

I still clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - cause I kill niggaz

You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy

Well I had it up to here, that's why a brother buckin' trife
And gettin' way with murder, this the motherfucking life
At a jam, nine figure on shelf
While your army a nigger snickering among self - thiefs
Who wanna clock the bread off the next
That's why Im gonna blow their fucking head off
Maybe the victor get stuck up
Giving these clowns opportunity to fuck up
They knowin' that the kid crew showers, eye cowers
And leaves for 'bout a good two hours
While they're like 'we coulda caught Rick what, for allsort'
That's what the assholes thought
Tough guy mumblin', I thunderin'
Why I had a motherfucking A-K ya wondering
And raise it higher, start giving them the fire
As they scream like high pitch women like Mariah
Blood on the wall like, other brothers ball like they hit
Seein' shots split a motherfuckers skull like lettuce
Run a nigger best bet is for another duck in gage
I'm in a motherfucking rage
Mask 'bout face, Now figure dash
Smash 'bout 10 ta 15 nigger ass out
More enemy dug, deceased, caught
Had not, gave one fuck what police thought (what?)
But first I best provide all brainiacs
With evidence of a suicidal maniac

You know I called you up cos nothing takes your place
I've got a heart of stone and it's sinking deep inside
I want to tell you love I'm too proud to cry

If you can see the lights shine in front of me
If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be
Summer's gone and I can't tell you lies
Oh forgive me love I'm too proud to cry

If you can see the lights shine in front of me
If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be
Summer's gone and I can't tell you lies
Forgive me love I'm too proud to cry
Too proud to cry

Too proud to cry

Come to find out God loves me
Come to find out I was not alone

You found me

Regeneration, a new sensation
the rebuilding of my broken heart
I've put my faith into action
I've got a clean, a brand new start
The more I seek, the more I find you
It seems the wonders never cease
How can I ever re-pay you
Help me Lord to see just what you say

You found me

Empty dreams, hollow schemes
Don't get trapped into the things of this world
you'll find out like I found out
that won't fill your life no!

Gym Class Heroes,To Bob Ross With Love (Album Version),"now who you know leave the scene
messier than canvas's by Jackson Pollock
throwing multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace
I make a mess you dissect it and make sense of it
then get back to me at your earliest convenience
check my verbal sequence as I texturize these tracks
seven layers to be exact eliminate the whack
with a firm brush stroke I mc paintily
lyricists begin crumbling from my stumbling technique
as I tweak your audio and visual keep my drips minimal messages subliminal
cause me and rap go way back we compliment
so together we enhance one another that's common sense
high intensity catches the eye your jaw drops
be a real critic not explicit with false props
I keep my darks deep my lights bright I'm very thorough
with my chiaroscuro inspiration spark and a knife
Now watch me rock the spot like? minus the heroin
and make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn
its kinda scary when real art gets left behind
while they take bullshit and start sellin' it to blind folks
but I remain humble as long as? continues spinnin' hot shit
on his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel
fuck mass appeal art is art only the real can truly feel it
so open your eyes and listen
combine your ears with vision
or do it cause you love it
or for cash that's your decision
that's your decision
that's your decision

its like I'm torn between two worlds
a paintbrush and a microphone
a canvas or a beat
CD or LP
anything goes when my ink pen flows
and God only knows where its gonna bring me next
so I'm inclined to like paint rhymes and spit kaleidoscopes with one eye closed
and I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
you know the cycle ass ho don't front
it goes inspiration and productivity then a sense of self worth and in steps depression
like back and forth and forth and back
should I paint a picture or record a track
a gift or a curse I don't know I'm still undecided
but over the years I've found clever ways to hide it
and those that lack the passion I have may despise it
but my momma made me this way I thank her everyday
so tell them kids to keep coloring outside the lines
until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
tell them teachers that you want your money back this time
and tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees
and tell my momma that her baby boy is doing just fine
although hes running out of patience but his mind is free
and tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
and that his son is two steps away from where he needs to be",happy,1
Stellar Kart,I Give Up (Album Version),"I am overrated
One of the future faded
Who bought into the scam
All I thought was something
Still adds up to nothing
So everything I am

I give up
I'm laying it down
I've had enough
Of living without you
I'm letting go
Of what I was
So long
Goodbye
Go

If I'm being honest
How could you have wanted
This heart so defective
But what it all comes down to
When my world revolves around you
I begin to live

I surrender

I'm not holding back

Far away where no one's waiting, so far from home, so far from home

I keep on going, keep on going...

Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress and your arms are reaching through the night
I'll never give up the fight
I'll go the distance

There's a thread that runs between us pulling 'cross this great divide
It's only there for the believers
Don't stop believing, don't stop believing

Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress and your arms are reaching through the night
I'll never give up the fight
I'll go the distance, I'll go the distance

There's a neverending story that begins with you and I
Like the rose outside your window
Don't let it die, don't let it die

Close your eyes and see my blue skies breaking through these dark clouds
You are the light
In my mind I see your red dress and your arms are reaching through the night

Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggaz I'ma die tryin for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turnin back my nigga cause we takin it there

Strictly raw shit is what niggaz be seekin me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step.. for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus
While a lot of other niggaz don't be tellin you nothin
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggaz trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggaz from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggaz to my live niggaz everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin it there

It blows a cool breeze in the air
Of thoughts and shimmering hours of May
And all its feelings

I dared to walk down by the lane
Calm and fearless in the rain
I felt that you were by my side
Calm and tender

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May

Listen, all the time we witness miracles,
All the time!

We thought that anyone that has a life
Bear the cross of the passion and of the time
Oh, the way I was blind!

The time I stumbled over your blue eyes
I felt like falling into a pool of joy
And a sort of miracle happened
The ancient fortress vanished at your smile

Has blown all darkness far away

Blackalicious,World Of Vibrations (Album Version),"(feat. Ledisi) 

[Gift of Gab] 
We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations 
Introduction to the nation of revolutionary thoughts 
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and change 
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter 
So y'all niggaz still ego trip based and 
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss 
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the stages 
Play this on your play list 
I like dough 
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical 
And don't blame me for the slang and the words 
God writes these rhymes through me 
I just listen to him 
I'm just livin' duke 
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me 
Cuz I still think abstract 
And stay metaphysical 
And challenge what is really real 
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back 
Not that it's away 
But everybody got somethin' to say 
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now 
And make that hot 
So it will get exploited 
And the corporation only will back dudes who bite my style 
And they can try and try again 
I've been influenced by a lot of pioneers 
South to the East and West 
But when a hot MC 
Gets on stage with a real MC 
Most of the time the situation gets hostile 

[Chorus: Ledisi] 
We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Welcome to our world and intro to 
Fall into a space 
Where there is no thoughts 
Just moments captured 
Here we go 

We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Let us up inside your head 
Just step inside our world of vibration 
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed 

[Gift of Gab] 
Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within 
In a world of BS that we're livin' in 
To my ears music sound sweet as cinnamon 
So I stay poundin' out tunes and tunes again and again 
In the 5th chapter ladies and gentlemen 
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu 
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though 
On second thought, I'm like a letter man though 
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome 
Shootin' through your vains, vibratin' though your eardrums 
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes 
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum 
Seen the world two times all except for India 
About to vacate there when we finish this one 
Work hard but still some sweep 
We won't mention them 
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine 
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin' 
When we're done with this these songs are our pension 
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson 
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen 
City, town, state arena or convention 
Please believe these the G's that ease pension 
Rakka and Ev said that it's a marathon 
Song after song, we keep on inventin' 

[Chorus] - repeats",happy,1

[Quik] Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)
[Luda] Ay man let me ask you somethin man
[Luda] You ever have one of them days where you felt like
[Luda] you mighta got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
[Luda] Y'knahmean like you just got your paycheck
[Luda] Paid off a car note or somethin
[Luda] Just jumped out the shower feelin fresh than a muh'fucka
[Luda] Witcha good shoes on, y'knahmtalkinbout?
[Quik] You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?
[Luda] Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
[Luda] Like call e'rybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
[Quik] In Compton we call that spur of the moment
[Luda] Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin on child suppo't

[DJ Quik]
Well my baby momma is, because she see havin kids
as a tool for gettin chips, that's with or without the dip
She told my lawyer she's a nurse but she can't spell school
Quite frankly she's a motherfuckin fool, idiot
Welcome to the city where you might see thangs
Like real threats, fake breasts, negativity hangs
over the city like a puppet string, pullin you up
You think they love you 'til the director yells cut
Now they packin you with ice and zippin you up

[Chorus]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
[KJ] And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright
G'd up, my mind is freed up
[KJ] From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright

[DJ Quik]
Now on Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that's out to steal your bag and your jewels
But we check your medication just to see if you cool
You can't be dyin on us, after you live off of hemp
We party hard, like Ludacris Kim and Shock and them
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hen be
And hemp be the beats we flip thee and we pimps thee simply

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive, riiiiight

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite kipper
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
Now if it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Or you'll be wonderin where yo' house went
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show 'em in the back of my truck, at the FreakNic
Trick, what'chu workin with?

The Gathering,Gaya's Dream,"(Infatuated by the extensiveness of the universe, it's easy to forget one of the most complex enigmas of this world: The human mind, a universe of it's own.)

Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Centuries through mankind's eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

Slowly walking, pacing front
See through these blind eyes
Stepping on shadows, touching air
Stones move as I stand still
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

For years of space technology
Still we haven't learned
Like children we explore
Things we can't yet comprehend

Open the doors of the past
With the beating of a heart
Dream as the years go by
Carrying our own cross
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes",sad,0
Lupe Fiasco,Streets On Fire (Explicit Album Version),"(Intro - Matthew Santos)
Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight",sad,0
Twista,It Feels So Good (Album Version),"(INTRO) This goes out to all riders worldwide
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
where playa hatin killers and the hood niggaz thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive

(Verse 1)
One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home cuz one of them
got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit 
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin too much though
We just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes 
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
and slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
and we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
but hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
cause it feels so good

(Chorus)
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good 
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes 
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go

(Verse 2)
Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
when niggas we lust smokin some but the flame tight
Trippin off how we survivin the rugged terrain
and try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night 
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap
Even we sent Deebo back to back to back
We still be holdin' stacks of packs
Rollin through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Rollin the chrome out really trippin
because we take the smoke to the dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones
glisten from all the sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight
Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques 
Now together we mush
but when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin every one of y'all my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hopin to get my thang on
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
(so the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Now we got up on hittin the cuz
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves
mo' we got up on some bud
Straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone
Smokin delight the body right what the party like
Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky
But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high
cause it feels so good

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Sittin back cruising through the slow breeze
thinkin how can I get mo' cheese
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
I stay on my P's for the po-P's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through
Sit on the floor playin Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin you
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
Bring out the best in you 
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs
and where they been hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy
what you feelin on maybe soft with the silicone baby
but can you pay me?
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll
while rockin dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about
how later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks
Now is that news or not?
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O""
Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro
on billets take a choke on so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life
but the hood life was still a good life
and that we know always and forever though
for ever more rollin in the ghetto with nowhere to go
and it feels so good

(Chorus 3X)",happy,1

Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them niggas)

(Verse 1:)

I let the whole world know that I can't be stopped,
Even without Doc I'm still from the (Streets of Compton),
Yeah nigga I said it, and I'ma stay on top,
Like a hoodrat with bomb ass cock,
Run up in 'em like these rap niggas, I ain't gotta clap niggaz,
End your career with one line like that niggaz,
Hit the switch front and back, make it bounce,
Let it jump, Killa-for-ni-a is where I'm from,
3 wheelin' with the ass out, smoke chronic 'til I pass out,
All the way to my nigga Daz house,
He always gotta big bad bitch from Long Beach,
She a known freak and she gotta long reach,
She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it, never back down,
'specially when Al Green in the background,
Now bitch hit the weed and turn that ass round,
It's time to bring back Chronic into Doggystyle,
Westcoast niggaz still holdin' shit down,

(Chorus: (The Game)

I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,

(Verse 2:)

I'm back on the cover of the Source and the XXL,
Floatin' all through the (Streets of Compton),
I got more bitches, more plaques, more beef, and more straps,
That's what the fuck I call ""Gangsta rap"",
I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turn enemies,
Streets kept me laced like bloods dipped in hennesse,
You niggaz act like the Game can't roll 'em out,
One man show still sell a motherfucker out,
We know Dre still sell a motherfucker out,
'cus everybody here from the (Streets of Compton),
We got crip niggaz, blood niggaz, assays, asians,
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces,
I kept you niggaz waiting had to take you back to the basics,
Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Daitons,
Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbating,
I run though hoes like Walter Payton on the daily,
I got your main bitch swallowing my babies,

(Chorus: (The Game)

I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,

Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them niggaz)

I'm the Westcoast Rakim, got you niggaz blocked in,
Glass house parked sideways on the stock rims,
New school, old school mentality,
Translation - Four pumps and twelve batteries,
Hydraulics make the world go round,
Your girl go down, chronic make your girl slow down,
For she end up like superhead, giving superhead,
Every nigga in the industry now fuck superhead,
And I might just fuck her too,
If I ever catch her sliding or riding through the (Streets of Compton),
Rolling down Green Leaf smoking on that green leaf,
With a Mac 10 like I was born on Queen's Street,
Murder MCs like I was born in Queen's Bridge,
That how I show you palm niggas where the King is,
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock,
I'm in the Hall Of Fame next to Snoop, behind 'Pac,
I got the whole motherfucking world locked,

(Chorus: (The Game)

I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,
It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop niggas)
Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton

(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them niggas)

(Outro:)

Everybody wanna know what the fuck is going on,
Am I signed to Aftermath? Interscope? What's up with Geffen?
I'ma just say it like this:
One day I walked in the motherfuckin' house,
And all my shit was gone.",sad,0

You say there's someplace that you gotta be
Find peace of mind and serenity
With a little help from modern chemistry
25 dollars can buy it
Just say yes...yes
Just say yes...yes

You're sliding down that slippery slope
You're the very reason why they call it dope
Yellin' for someone to throw yo uthe rope
Tell all your friends they should try it
Just say yes...yes
Just say yes...yes

I don't know what they're saying
Russian roulette I'm playing
It's straight I should be staying
Inside a chapel praying
My conscience I'll be saving
For now I'll just keep saying yes

Now I'm age 43
Waiting by the phone for a new kidney
I wish I didn't have to hurt to take a pee
That's not gonna stop me

Twista & The Speedknot Mobstaz,Warm Embrace (LP Version),"(Liffy Stokes) 
It's like I got the 4 4 cocked 
On the block in it two door dropped 
And my spot is keepin' but hot 
The pussy ass cop throw some murder in the lot 
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me 
The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies 
F**k what the reason be I'ma start squeezin' these 
Them niggas ain't G's they wanna be thugs 
And it ain't shit these ain't no muthaf**kin' slugs 
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here 
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears 
Brought to life momma's worst fears 
Pictures of a son dyin' from that hot ones flyin' 
Baby mama's cryin' at the funeral 
'Cause the magnum lit him like a black (?) 
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo 
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin' up co-co 
I got to tip on the low-low 
Bust it there like po-po takin' lives with the, oh no 
It's a 4-4 many missles with a silent sub for the whistle 
My favorite pistol 
'Cause when I let that bitch ride 
I know the homicide is being counted out, it's official 
Niggas steady bumpin' guns, but don't want none 
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact 
A maniac just prepared to die in combat 
Besides all that my 4-4 keeps my laced: Dawg he paid and safe 
I can see the fear in your face as I reach my waist for this warm embrace 

(Chorus) 
I got plenty love for the 4-4 
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go 
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the 4-5 
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride 
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the nine-mill 
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill 
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace 
All you muthaf**kas better duck and hide 
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside 
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace 

(Mayz) 
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives 
With my customized 4-5 
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys 
You muthaf**kas better get wise 
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin' to kill the elite 
'Cause you ain't gettin' no more tries 
Make the nigga's nubian mother weap, but f**k it 
As long as I don't get whole cries 
Put the beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise 
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five 
Make sure that nigga crossed me dies 
You don't wanna throw them thangs 
When I cocked and aim (?) think in these few seconds time 
But Mayz ain't new to the game 
I use the spark when we start to light up this thunderin' crime 
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin 
(?) pretend to be your friend 'til they get close enough to your ends 


To do you in, that shit puts me on ten 
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend 
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin' big shit about war 
Like he don't know my stee, now mob's gon' win 
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name 
'Cause I put a f**kin' bullet into your closest skin 
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe 
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin 
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace 
Before I f**k up your face like a can of mace 
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case 
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace 

(Chorus) 

(Twista) 
Would you (..?..) of the team, for sure 
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go 
Miss millimeter's makin' the (?) muthaf**kas gotsta be ruckus 
When I get my clutches upon this hoe 
Itchin' to let the barrel blow 
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow (..?..) 
Spit 'em up and swallow slow 
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back 
Payback from flashback, some bitches know 
Bust 'til I see the chrome from the intro 
You was f**ked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion 
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked 
F**k the gauge and enemies get (?) up from the blazin' 
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass 
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list 
Deposition die for servin' them six 
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick 
'Cause I be working my bitch 
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang 
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon 
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds 
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug 
When it comes to (?) run about she draw my blood 
Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud 
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug 
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock 
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess 
F**k the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls 
If I see I'll be laid to rest, let me hit the sex 
Lose (?) but used to be a problem solver 
But the nina made me a baller 
Go strapped and take the place of the black nine 
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste 
From my warm embrace 

(Chorus) 

I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4 
Warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 
Warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill",happy,1

I sent myself a dozen roses
Right before the office closes
Just to make my girlfriends green with envy
Ever since I lost you
All the crazy things I do
I didn't even know I had it in me.. Oh but

Hey it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody.. got no nothin to lose
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Spread a little misery round
Anything's better than feelin the blues

Found a restaurant on my way
Told 'em it was my birthday
Just to hear the waiters sing off-key
I've sprung a loose wire.. that's a fact
Got a strange little monkey on my back
But I kinda like the company.. and I guess

Hey, it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody.. got no nothin to lose.
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Dance the little monkey around
Anything's better than feelin' the blues

Hey it's alright. 
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody... got no nothin to lose.

But this is private, between you and I

Touch my body
Put me on the floor, wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed, I just wanna make you feel like you never did

Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs all around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body
I know you like my curves, come on and give me what I deserve and
Touch my body

Imma treat you like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury, laying intertwined with me
You won't work for nothin', boy, I will give you plenty

Touch my body
Put me on the floor, wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed, I just wanna make you feel like you never did

Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs all around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body
I know you like my curves, c'mon and give me what I deserve and
Touch my body

Elvenking,Trows Kind,"(Music / Lyrics: Aydan)

Concealed from the view
Hidden from the knowledge of Men
A little kind through trees it lives
Nymphs of dark and lust
""Fairy of bad fate!""
Somebody tells he has seen
Some of the little ones
Some even that have talked with them
So nice and handsome
""Please, don't be such a fool!
Tell everyone that the witches come tonight""

(Bridge:)
Desire grows, denial howls
Your will has gone
""Divine the wicked multitude
Worship your servitude""
Enthroned and ringed with gold
Of the mighty old oak
I'm on the lightness side

(Chorus:)
Daughters and sons
There are times to carry on,
All my life for you
Keep on singing my tale
Deny the Trows kind
Don't you dare to stay behind?
Through years and centuries,
Through myth and poetry
Our race's slowly dying
In the heart of mankind

Deep in the woods
They're dressed with the fruits of earth
Arcane adorers of the roots
Dance Henking tonight
""Fairy of bad fate!""
Vanishing through branches
Followeed by the Redcaps
They?re greddy for silver and gold

(Bridge and chorus)

Trapped in a web of branches and leaves dead
You hear voices reciting a prayer...
Come nearer and see!
""Hare hare good sent the care
I am in a haire likeness, just see me there
But I shall be in a woman's likeness soon""",sad,0

Michael McDonald,Love Can Break Your Heart (LP Version),"(Paul Carrack And Michael McDonald)

With a future as bright as we see
We got to go in with our eyes open wide
For as good as love can be
I can't help being afraid in the back of my mind
For all the dreams we see come true
Girl there's one thing that can't be denied

Baby, we've got a long road ahead
We haven't even started yet
Which makes it easy to forget

Baby, love can break your heart
I know it will baby
Love can break your heart
That's just the other side of it
Love can break your heart
So give it all you can give
'cause nothing short of that will do
So it's gotta be worth it to me
It's gotta be worth it to you

I know we can read all the signs
But after all only time's gonna tell

Girl, I'm not afraid to take a chance
Put my heart into your hands
As long as we both understand

...that's gotta be good enough for me
Girl that's gotta be good enough for you

So it's gotta be worth it to me
It's gotta be worth it to you",sad,0

Dilated Peoples,Big Business,"(Rakaa Iriscience)
no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line...
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

Cookin' a good Maxwell House, she moved away
Some said to Memphis and some said to Leland

But I found her, I wanted her to cook me
Some good Maxwell's House.  I understand
If I can get me just a spoonful of Maxwell's House, 
(it'll) Do me much good as two or three cups this other coffee

Well, I'm just got to have my lovin'...

Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck..

Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

(God)
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware

Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me

It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane

(God)
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same

(Sticky)
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

(God)
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using

(Sticky)
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

(Sticky)
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?

(God)
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity

(Sticky)
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain

(God)
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

(Sticky)
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?

(God)
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest

(Sticky)
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?

(God)
The process of all life
is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self

(Sticky)
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

(God)
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God",sad,0
Suicidal Tendencies,Human Guinea Pig,"(Suicidal Tendencies)

(From F.N.G. compilation, 1992)

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight
The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 

They said it was for science
But I'm the human guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig

My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes
The nightmare continues, I see through their lies
The papers keep turning, the tests never ends
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration

They said it was for science
But I feel like the human guinea pig

Time may have passed on, but I won't soon forget
The old sensation, pure frustration of a human guinea, guinea pig",sad,0

It can't be bought
Your mind can wander

Play rock and roll

Has Jesus round her neck

The youth them getting restless and they don't want you near. 
Your watching us your watching us it so improper 
We've seen your kind before we call it informer.

This world she no like you so you better stay low. 
And up from the mountains and out from the trees, 
That is where you come from you crawl like the one disease.

So now you pass me the laser beam 
And you want me to join the team. 
Well Im not used to these kinds of things, 
But this is what the evil brings. 
Let me tell you bout the fire. 
You could bring the waters up above. 
I'll bring my favorite people and I'm bringing all my love. 
You want a battle well don't look very far, 
You want to fight somebody come fight the superstar. 
I knew you wouldn't stand a chance you left without a passing glance, 
There's nothing you could ever do to keep me from stopping you

(verse 3:) 
It's so dark and lonely out here in outer space, 
But at least I got my keyboard and my low bot has his bass.
Playing street sweeper tunes and watching TIE fighters fly by. 
Things would be better if I was back at home with Pepper 
Burning pakalolo not even noticing the weather 
So far and so alone a million light years away.

I got my blaster set I'm ready to start a minor war. 
This won't be the day you were hoping for so just walk away walk away. 
Better run now cause your done now cause your standing in a bad mans town, boy. 
Time to get back to my daily routine have a beer at a bar on Tattooine.

You take away everything, make my people scream out loud. 
Just bring it back 
Lord just bring it back. 
You mess it up and you rearrange open your eyes and turn the page. 
Just bring it back.

(chorus 2:) 
I believe I'll interject to talk about the word respect. 
Its not a word that's in your hands
Its more about the common man 
You took your time and paved the way 
Making room for other man to play a
Grip of bodies a mess of minds endless conversations to rock.

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

""Get down, get down, on down.."" like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I ""Get on up!"" rhythm and funk
Makes you hump like Technotronic I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""to chill..."" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ahhhhhh, you guessed it!"" I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut

Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... on your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O.
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut

DJ Quik,Born and Raised In Compton,"[ VERSE 1 ]
Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin nothin but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin
I do as I please, you see 
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)

(Where you from, fool?) 
(Compton)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see 
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively 
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win 
Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n 
Kick it

(Born and raised)

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

Yo, check this shit out

I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear
What's up nigga?
What's up KK?

We got AMG most definitely in the house

Mase,Wanna Hurt Mase? (Album Version),"[1] - Do you really wanna hurt Mase? 
Or do you really wanna make me cry? 
Or is it really that you envy Mase?
Or you don't really wanna see me fly? 

Do you really wanna hurt Mase? 
Or do you really wanna make me cry? 
Or is it really that you envy Mase?
Or you don't really wanna see me fly? 

Now you don't wanna see me angry
Ain't enough cops or cuffs to chain me
Days to arraign me, KKK's to hang me, insane me
Ya need ice picks to bang me
Need more than a straight jacket to restrain me
Or more guns with my prints for you to frame me and mame me
Nigga, look at you and look at us
My duns don't fuss, Harlem win you with a thrush
Nigga you better hush, I can mess out the cave 
Niggas still get touched
And them little ones you bust ain't enough for us
Listen here, Mase'll make you disappear
And yo' mouth'll be the reason that you missed this year
Man who needs ya? You don't need me, I don't need you neither
That's why my next Lex gon' be a two seater
And the things I do to you won't leave you beautiful
And though yo' feelin' fuck me, I'm feelin' mutual 

[Repeat 1]

From the M to the A nigga dollar sign E
Come around money if you ever tryin' to find me
I was murder for six years, seen no clean from it
Drop murder off, Mase woke up at Teen Summit
My niggas joke, niggas broke, kill a laugh
I got power, make a call, get a mil' in cash
Like my money and ya ain't cuz they don't tax me
Actually, anything you got to ask me, fax me
I'm no Beamer dreamer, I'm a Bentley man
Car totally smashed threw out 50 grand
How ya figure ya bigger when Mase that nigga
And every style I deliver come with much charisma
Knock it off, now will ya , I'm the one that bitches live for
Don't get me wrong you niggas make it hot I make it sizzler
And I don't know you cats, so don't you get familiar
And if you violate me and mine I guarentee I peel ya

[Repeat 1]

If I ever whisper on a remix, I got C-chips
Time is money, when you talk gotta be quick
I don't see how ya'll hang or even be wit
Niggas ridin' in the Benz with only one V-6
But I know how it is when ya go into the bar
Got girls overreact, they thowin' you a star 
Got niggas player hatin' don't even know who you are
And go as far as leavin' bullet holes in yo' car
When you're from Harlem World niggas never see yo' views
They wait for you to flop or be on BET News
All they see the G's and jewels, V's that ya cruise
Being the underdogs, they can't wait to see us lose
Don't hate me, thank me
I don't get mad when nigga's bitches prank me
Make you cranky to see me places that you can't be
I'm too pretty to let you niggas shank me 
And frankly, know you probably hate me cause you ain't me

Follow again one single piece
of dream afar
Spent my all whole life there,
chasing the hope

A drive so strong,
so deep I cannot see the end
Inborn sense of finding
what's beyond, in the furious storm

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind

Watch my gold,
it can be never bought or sold
Made up and collected through the years
from emotions and dreams

A noble line I carry on 
Exploring the ways I never saw

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind
If you were given chance to fly would you
retain your tears of joy
Pushed as far as any wind will go,
a fiery stride to the sun

Clearing my path from anything
that leads me to a fall
On the brink of loneliness, I faced 
the illusion of leaving from the flock
On this one way trail to unfolding new
worlds",happy,1
The Game,Scream On Em,"[Swizz Beatz]
Yeah, y'all really want this to happen? (Game time!)
C'mon!

[The Game]
Homey it's hard not to kill niggas, it's like a full time job
Not to pull out the steel and shove it in your grill
Young California got that mass appeal
I summons the hood, they get up in yo' ass for real
Knockout flow, Winky Wright jab for real
And all you niggas pussy, need Massengil
See I'm the gun-cocker, one-shotter, lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down, like a cantaloupe, my flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so, motherfuckin' six-four
Your bitch know, hop in the back when you see Swizz hoe
This that, all you niggas get up off my dick so
I can cook crack on the track and watch it mix slow
Cocaine, my flow fire, call it propane
Every nigga know Game, five shots no pain
And that's the reason why I'm shittin' on you niggas
Shut me in the looney bin, I'm sicker than you niggas

[Chorus: x2]
This is that disrespectful, motherfuckin' West coast
Hip-hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go!

[The Game]
Where I'm from, I seen the most stand up niggaz lay down
Where skinny niggas make buff niggas victims of that trey-pound
And gang-bangers is the sharpshooters, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his ass down and take the money out his tube socks
West coast niggas is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas, make money with the smartest niggas
I ain't got time for you fuckin' artist niggas
Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the motherfuckin' sergeant nigga
Beauty pageant-ass niggas on the runway
(Boyz N The Hood) till they see the nigga in that red Hyundai
Blow his fuckin' back out, cause I'm the rap Stack-house
Black Wall Street bitch, the hip-hop crack-house, what?

[Chorus: x2]

[The Game]
My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly
Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the shit cancer
One man show cause I fucked all the dancers
Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These niggas let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean, mean, rappin' machine
Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary
I'm runnin' the buildin', don't make me run in the buildin'
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin'
Walkin' past offices I see my son in the buildin'
Last album on the wall I'm number one in the buildin'
They should build me an office up under the buildin'
My elevator goin' down, I am done in the buildin' nigga

[Chorus: x2]

[Swizz Beatz]
We in the motherfuckin' buildin' man
You ain't got your motherfuckin' mind right?
You gon' get your mind blown out your motherfuckin' mind right nigga
It is what the fuck it is man
How y'all wanna cut the cake?
You touch this you get your hands cut off, nigga
Swizz Beatz the motherfuckin' monster
Game is in the motherfuckin' buildin'
We could turn this whole motherfuckin' world red nigga

Eric Benet,Hurricane,"A calm serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide
Gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun

Surrounded by everything I want
But nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdity
Losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need
To find that road
Right around that curve a lesson learned
Now that I have the eyes to see

A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

With poison toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treause is
'Cause they only blocked my view
I'm spiraling down but so oblivious
Got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone

A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

Sometimes I cried, the tears wouldn't fall
And sometimes I tried to break those walls
And feel your love

When I finally found my way

A blue jean serenade
And moon river what'd you do to me?

I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands

Of revelation, set his soul on fire

But we still fear what we don't know

Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow

Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring

Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you?

Or did you leave it back in '61?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes

You're comfort on my mind and you're with me all the time.
And lots of feelings that I can't explain.

I won't spend another night alone.

Out of every girl I meet, no other can compete
I'd ditch 'em all for a night with you.
I know you don't believe you mean this much to me
But I promise you that you do.

If I had one wish this is what it would be...
I'd ask you to spend all your time with me,
That we'd be together forever.
We'd buy a small house in south central L.A.
Raise lots of kids then we'd both join a gang
Just as long as we're together.

The things you make me wanna do
I'd rob a quik-e mart for you
I'd go to the pound and let all the cats go free
Just as long as you'd be with me.

Ensiferum,Hero In A Dream,"A witch read from the palm of his hand
that his life would turn into darkness
and alone he would face all demons
from his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
that lie in the valleys of north and
his only change was to find his shadow
so he had to set forth

He is the man who travels in the land
of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
and he rules the forest of elves

Slash of the golden sword
a flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time

Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie

The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn

On the way to the ancient castle of time
he will soon be damned by rage
so that his pride could betray him
when it's time to set him free
The tears in his mind had to be pushed aside
as he walked through the gates
He will never die
'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream",happy,1

Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing

Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window

Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee 
Saying won't you please write a letter for me 
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away 
I coming to see her real soon I hope 
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat 

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope 
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail 
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale 

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way 
A big auto hit her and sped away fast 
The little girls prayers had been answered at last 

The postman was passing and picked up the note 
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke 
Straight up into heaven this letter did go

You had gone and changed your name

But you don't mind
'Cause lately things are all the same
Ain't it strange how peope always seem
To know your face
But just don't know your name
Well I don't care there's no-one there
That even turn around and say get out of this place
Last night I saw a shooting star
When morning comes
She hides away
A real disgrace

Is it true you're running round
Now is it true they're calling you

Is it true you're running round
Now is it true they're calling you

You got me caught up in a whirl
I want you here now Chelsea Girl

Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
'Cause his weakness is his heart

A lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Tones On Tail,Burning Skies,"And the air was alive

Don't tell me what I've heard before.
Destined to walk another day alone.
This day is dying.
This day is fucking dead.
Just shine my way back home.
You can stay if you find comfort.
Don't speak.
Just breathe instead.
Just don't leave me alone.
I don't just need it, I deserve it.
I want what I promised myself.
I want what you promised us all.

Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times 
You can't have my heart I'm taking back what's mine 
I know it lie just smoke in your eye and you saved my soul from the other side 

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me 
For you have been a refuge 

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall 
May the king answer you on the day that you call 
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled, 
heavens lay draped over New York like a prayer shawl,

Petra,Hollow Eyes (Beat The System Album Version),"Another day in Nigeria the children beg for bread, 
The crops failed, the well ran dry 
When they lost the watershed 

A baby dies, its mother cries, the children gather 'round 
They're wondering what the day will bring 
Will they be the next one found? 

(Chorus) 
Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 
Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes, 
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 

In the crowded sheds the children lay their heads 
To escape the Haitian heat 
The hunger pains drive them to the street 
Wond'ring if today they'll eat 
Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease 
Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease. 

The least of these is hungry. 
The least of these is sick. 
The least of these needs clothing. 
The least of these needs drink. 
The least of these knows sorrow. 
The least of these knows grief. 
The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.

Amil,Anyday,"Anyday 

(Verse 1)
Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at 
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things,
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and Im just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field

(Chorus 2x)
Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday

(Verse 2)
Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go

Chorus

(Verse 3)
I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds",sad,0

And all those things I left behind.

My eyes saw a far horizon,
As if to pierce this veil of time,
And escape this earthly prison.

Will there come a time when the memories fade.
and pass on with the long, long years,
When the ties no longer bind?
Lord save me from this darkest fear.
Don't let me come home a stranger,
I couldn't stand to be a stranger.",sad,0

About five, six strippers trying to work for a buck

And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lila, she went to junior high with me
I said: ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot has changed since I've seen you last"", she said

(What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money)

(And his daddy's gone, somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life, mmm)

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
But that's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said: ""Everyday I wake up hoping to die""

She said: ""Nigga, I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I'd done been through more shit you can't even relate to""

(What would you do if your son was at home

No, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Stop the record, yo, stop the record!
Yo, Shorty, you ain't gotta be goin' out like this, man!
(Holdup)

(What would you do?)
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
(What would you do?)
'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through

(Come on, what would you do?)
Get up on my feet and stop makin' tired excuses
(What would you do?)
Girl, I know if my mother could do it, baby, you can do it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Owl City,On The Wing,"Breathe, and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound

The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the Alpine Heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake, and thinking of
The weekend we were in love



Home among these mountaintops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside

I wish the rockets stayed over the Promenade
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?

Are you there?

Or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

I am floating away 
Lost in a silent ballet 
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

John Wesley,The Emperor Falls,"Brick by brick
stone by stone
dismantle the will of a man
strip his flesh and bone

Reach out your hand
the moment comes
blade catches the light of your eyes
the man slowly comes undone

Nobody noticed
no one saw a thing
all turned a blind eye to the fallen
and the bad luck he brings

You wake in the morning after
the sky's a color that you can't see
friends have fallen by the wayside
why isn't anyone talking to me
get those funny looks in the market
people you loved just stare
wander on with your hands in your pockets
even your girlfriend don't care

They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor

To watch the emperor fall

three parts deceit
two parts shit that you made up
add passion for heat

Did ya hear he said this
can you believe he done that
can you believe the nerve of the man
let me at him tell me where he's at
wake to your fave in the mirror
see someone you don't recognize
stare at the changes in the reflection

It'll drive you farther down
It'll drive you farther down...

Paying for a crime you weren't charged for 
Alive in a world that always wants more
Is it any wonder that you're falling back
Inside the pattern that defines all you lack?
Don't you want to get into your car and get out of this town?
Get out of this town?

Pouring in ecstasy
In performance or in ecstasy
I'm looking at you
Looking in through at me
I've come so far already
I've come so far already

It's a shame
Looking at you
Looking in through at me
All in ecstasy
I've come so far already
All in ecstasy
I've come so far already
All in ecstasy
I've come so far already
I've come so far
I've come so far
It's a shame
It's a shame
Looking at you
Looking in through at me

The Fabulous Thunderbirds,Why Get Up,"Carter-Ellsworth

Why get up, why get up
How can I get up, why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever why get up

Phone keeps ringing right off the hook
Some bill collector, I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed, dream all day
World outside bugs me anyway
When I get things going, the going gets rough
So I ask myself why get up

Chorus

Went to the doctor, he said lose some weight
If you don't do it quick, we'll have to operate
I talked to my lawyer, he said case is closed
That woman got it all even the garden hose
Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck
Better roll back over why get up

Chorus

Well I can't quit drinking, I'm nervous all the time
When I wake up, it's like a ton lead on my mind
What was it, I said to that girl last night
She really got upset, I best stay out of sight
I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff
I better duck under the cover why get up",sad,0

Sandi Thom,When Horsepower Meant What It Said,"Caught in the gridlock nose to tail across all lanes
Smog nearly chocking me as the car horns go insane
Patiently waiting to get their old jobs backs
Carrying the human race proudly on their backs

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

I've got a hundred horses hidden in between my wheels
But i can't put my foot down and jumped the fences in the field
Patiently waiting to get their old jobs back

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

And if we're keeping up with progress why am i standing still
Maybe we should take a walk and talk to the horses on the hill

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On water we have walked like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

Chorus

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

Chorus

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away
Only the children of our children
Know the price they had to pay

Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Christina The Astonishing (2010 Digital Remaster),"Christina the Astonishing
Lived a long time ago
She was stricken with a seizure
At the age of twenty-two

They took her body in a coffin
To a tiny church in Liege
Where she sprang up from the coffin
Just after the Agnus Dei

She soared up to the rafters
Perched on a beam up there
Cried ""The stink of human sin
Is more that I can bear""

Christina the Astonishing
Was the most astonishing of all
She prayed balanced on a hurdle
Or curled up into a ball

She fled to remote places
Climbed towers and trees and walls
To escape the stench of human corruption
Into an oven she did crawl

O Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in a terrifying way
She would run wildly through the streets
Jump in the Meusse and swim away

The first thing that I heard you say 
When you were standing there 
Set in your way was that you were not blind 
You were sure to make a fool of me 
Cause there was nothing there 
That you could see 
That could go beyond your mind 
Now who's standing at the door 
Remembering the days before 
And asking please be kind 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I've set you free this time 

I have never been so far out in front 
That I could ever ask for what I want 
And have it any time 
Knowing this you found a thought for me 
That told you just what I should be 
And there I stood behind 
With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to 
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be 
I've set you free this time 

I could never find a chance to choose 
Between a way to win or a thing to lose 
Because there was your stand 
On top of all the love you took 
There was only something 
You can look at lying in your hand 
Now who's wondering what has changed 
And why it can not be arranged 
To have each thing work fine 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I'll set you free this time",sad,0

And listen to the country radio
We'd hold on to each other while the singer sang
And we'd stay like that 'til it was time to go

Now think of the joy you received
When you reached out to someone else in need

Some days we cry
Some days we hold it deep inside
Though each day is a gift from on high

Amazing
There's so much more that's in Jesus name

Learning to give instead of just take

Running away, a trivial day
Of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold, this bounty soul
A gentile or a priest?
Who victored over, the Seljuks
When the Holy Land was taken

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

Was it the riches of the land
Powers of bright darkness
That lead the noble to the East
To fight the heathens

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it!

Now international security
The call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill man
History teaches us so
The reason he must attain
Must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war

Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore

He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl, 
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him 
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't buy

And why we couldn't work it out

Well, I was raised on a back street,
Time's were tough, but kind of bittersweet.
Left school when I was still a child,
Hit the streets and started running wild.
Hanging out in the neighborhood,
People said, ""They're up to no good!""
Never thought I'd ever make it through,
Hey boy, what you gonna do?

Crosstown traffic, sirens wailing, screaming in my ear.
It's got me on the run, gotta move on out of here.

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me,
From this dead end street, oh yeah.

They still talk about the big fight,
On the backstreet at midnight.
Everybody heard the gunfire,
Saw him dragged into the Black Maria.
Now my best friend is doing time,
He's committed to a life of crime.
Got a feeling I'll be next in line,
I wonder how can I get out in time?

I stepped into a movie, this can't be reality.
If I wasn't so lucky, I wonder where I'd be?

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me,
From this dead end street, oh yeah.

How invulnerable

What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?

Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the

crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.

I scatter the ashes of destiny

can i decide between a psycho and a citizen,
no chance of that i want death to my enemy,
i'm not a man, i'm not a man,

It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibrate does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men

Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown

The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like ""Pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""

around town, windows down at the South Town, Cool J tape or K-Solo ""Spellbound""
With fly girlies dippin, brothers grippin' and sippin'
Old Gold, Red Bull, hands on my dick and
I'm just lampin' with my EK shades, truck-jewels, obviously the man's paid.
But of course not, brother can't get his props

Ever since you said goodbye 
I felt so all alone

Summer showers soak the ground 
I watch the rain come pouring down

I hang my head and want to die

Just not making it on my own

Sometimes late at night 
I close my eyes 
And pretend that you're here with me

Every time it rains 
Every time I hear the raindrops fall 
I may say I don't mind it at all

Buried in the backyard shadow
The rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a
Nameless dream

Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless

The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

To walk along beside You and never look away 
Just Your whisper and the wind and sea obey 

To see You feed the people 
To feel Your healing in Your touch 

To hear You pray in the garden alone 
Laying down Your will with each tear 
To see You walk that lonely road 
Willing to die for me 
And in that moment 
I know I should have been there 
You took my cross and gave Your life 

And You live again!

Wish I could have been there

Kenny Rogers,Love Is What We Make It,"Girl, we've come a long, long way
Too far for us to end this way
Sometimes the cost of love is hard
And we must pay this little give-and-take

So don't you think if you and I
Were just about and let our hearts decide
Maybe it would all work out in time
So won't you stay, please don't go away.

Love, love is what we make it
We can make it so much better if we try
Love, love is what we make it
So let's make it real good this time.

Is it too late to change your mind?
Or has it gone to fall this time
Won't you hold me just one more time
Let's just say:  ""there's a chance for you and me""

Love, love is what we make it...",happy,1

I admit you wont see me again. My end is desperately engaged. Dark, departed, hollow.
You see I'm just a shadow. This ravenous beast is chasing shame. A shadow he remains.
How will my voice carry tonight? How do i look under these lights? Shove my head into the grand ivory keys.
Maybe this will teach me how to sing. Fuck hope, I'm a terror. Heavyweight human disaster.
I think I found Love. but what's love? When we cant be loved? Burn, burn, burn it down.
Icarus just hit the ground. To the youth that thought they could fly. I bottled up just drank up and died.

Survived without you
Bringing out the kid in me
Now I'm resigned to say

Only you
You and only you
You and only you
can take this heart
And make it new
You and only you

To make something of my day
But I hopelessly drift away
To the place where
We can be alone again
I'll never be the same again

You have to get up on your dancing feet
You will have no time to eat 'cos the beat is so much stronger than you

I observe and I learn
Today I have been reversed
And it seems to me now like I'm the center of the universe

Hey! look at me!
People ask me if I am going insane
But I say it's just this missile in my vein
It comes on hard, there's no stop no start
And it kicks so strong, the kick goes on
Over and over 'til you can't belong,
It's an endless song
One, two, three, it goes on 
Ooo, Mental Beat, Ooo, Mental Beat

Your hero is a zero
And you're just another weirdo
It comes on like a bomber, a long distance drummer
If you can't hear the beat you must be deaf

Hanoi Rocks has got the beat
Boy! they never seem to sleep!
And the only explanation is that there is no protection against the Mental Beat

And you might think people don't live
through being dead wrong

A strictly pious daughter 'cause you
Move through this crowd just like parting water
You dress so nice

A pulling current that could bring me to my knees
Where was I during the beating
Separation of body mind and...

Part of me wasn't even there

I can still see his face
The lines upon his face
And if could erase the hate
That breeds this nightmare
And how was I to know
A child of twelve years old
A hollow seed

Whatever I
Want to be

When I used to know a little girl high on this world
Your baby loves you more than you know
Raised on rivalry and rock'n roll
Moving to the motor City soul

On the radio
Well we never had a lot of cash
But we loved those kids
Some say that she missed the boat
But she just burned the bridge
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock'n roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
She takes hold
On the radio
Stomachache Sundays
And books we never read
Well I was hoping one day
We might meet again
She used to talk about astrology
She was born in June
She danced with strangers and celebrities
Empty stars and the full moon
I was thinking about the universe
For what its worth
Or the one about the Phoenix bird
That died and then returned
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock' n roll

Set Your Goals,summer jam,"December 26th, 04. Dan's dad's dropping of the van for the Make Move tour. We're meeting up soon with The Warriors. We're losing money and our lunches on the jeans Matt wore to the first show. We're on the road.

May 22nd, 06. Zoli just tried to Ignite a roman candle stick. We're troubling the stateside with CIS. A full-blown assault on the whole US. Take on the world and see it all.

Even as we get older we can do it all over. Make our own plans and score the music to our own lives. Looking into the future, there is more room to move here, invincible as we score the music to our own lives.

And sometimes Snacksidents will happen, and it's so hard to keep your Razzberry Cool. Hey, I'm in Georgia with Fireworks and Justin K. We're all in a holding cell but somehow Baloni got away. I'm just trying to get my smoothie on, dawg.

Even as we get older we can do it all over. Make our own plans and score the music to our own lives. Looking into the future, there is more room to move here, invincible as we score the music to our own lives.

Now we gotta react, we gotta think fast. Side-bust hits leave us delirious. Outspoken hearts, restless as sharks. My life, my pride. Save me the daylight. Bring me home. It's OK because my way has only got to work for me. I'm trying my hardest to make the most of every minute. Time flies. And the top of the world is calling. Time grabs me by the shoulders.

I begged you not to leave, but you left any-way
I saw my castle tumble back to earth and there was I
With mem'ries of my castle in the sky.

The trouble that we're havin', does it mean there's someone new
Or am I just bothered by the thought of losing you
Will someone come and take you, will I lose you by and by
Like I lost you in my castle in the sky.

Can I buy you a drink?

	Aiyyo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajira, Guantanamera
	Hey yo John Forte, she's eyeing me from far
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajira Guan-tana-mera

Verse Two: Lauryn Hill

Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamacita beg your pardon
Make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates
Pure traits of genius, Goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggaz angry cause they can't get between us
to no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo
and then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera

(Wyclef responds to singing again)

LORE,Release,"He left his cigarettes

How long before they're stale

I still smell him on my sheets

I linger in the memory

He said he's never been in love

And doesn't know what love means

So I tell him, so I tell him

To love is to release



Fear leads nowhere

Fear leads nowhere



It's easier to love than not to love

Aah aah

How long before they're stale

I can't take much more of this

I linger in this emptiness

He said he's not ready for this

And doesn't know if he'll be

To love is to release

Iggy Pop,Main Street Eyes,"This whole country is scared of failure.
My head keeps trying to sell me ambition,
But in my heart, I want self-respect.
There's a conflict.

Boy, I feel so outgunned today
But I'll get up and fight back, anyway
You and I are not huge mainstream stars
But unlike them, we're really what we are

We got main street eyes
Watchin' as the big boys roll by
Under rotten television skies
We got main street eyes

I saw a kitten squashed in the street
I read about a plastic surgeon and his art 
Collection.

We are played for suckers all the time
Phony rock and roll
It's a crime
I don't want to dip myself in trash
I don't want to give myself for cash

We got main street eyes
Tryin' to do what' decent with our lives
Under funny television skies
We got main street eyes

Walkin' around sometimes
I see a tension under the surface
People are just about ready to explode.

So hold me, and trust me
I love you. Don't worry.

Sister Hazel,Vacation Rain (Album),"I shut my eyes and it all comes racing in
Everytime it rains, I can feel you on my skin
A storm of chance when fate was hard to find
Seven days that we left behind
Left behind

And everything we were, everything underneath the sun
The waves kept crashing and a storm had just begun
Forces colliding to one moment in time
Seven days, when it rained, you'd shine

Remember the nights? Remember the days?
Remember the vacation rain?
Remember the way life used to taste?
Remember the vacation rain, rain?
Rain, rain

The earth was shaking and the ground was getting wet
The time we were taking, I never will forget
The summer winds were changing and coming to an end
Seven days we'd never see again

Remember the nights? Remember the days?
Remember the vacation rain?
Remember the way life used to taste?
Remember the vacation rain, rain?
Rain, rain

Don't it take you back
Like a photograph
Hanging in your mind frame?
Wish that I could go back
But the fact is
It never feels the same
When it rains

Every now and then I wanna feel that way again
Seven days

Owl City,On The Wing,"Breathe, and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound

The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the Alpine Heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake, and thinking of
The weekend we were in love



Home among these mountaintops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside

I wish the rockets stayed over the Promenade
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?

Are you there?

Or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

I am floating away 
Lost in a silent ballet 
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

Still photos and noisy arcades

Look down and keep on singing

And I found fault
In everyone but me

I was hurt and alone
I could not find my way home
Broke-down and hungry
And too tired to moan

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
A world of confusion

I was there by myself
Couldn't find no help no where else
Thought I'd call up the hotline
But there was nobody there

Then I heard somebody calling my name

Who died in the process
And who got paid a starvation wage? Shopcops protect
A terrifying place
Willing to serve you 24 hours a day
Slick etiquettes
A great masquerade
Fluorescent tubes illuminate milelong aisles
Aseptic floors
Colorful shelves: myriads of products, but all their content is the same
Fooled and deceived
Who made us fall for this sham?
Who made us swallow the bait that we need all that shit?
Place your blind faith
In every produce
Don't hesitate or enquire, just follow our rules
No one complains
Customer is king
Why would you bother, just enter the pin
Who made us fall
Fall for the myth
That we would be better off with everything at our fingertips?
No one realized
How somewhere along the line
We have surrendered to the great void in our lives
Overwhelmed by the immense selection
Exerted to cover our inanition
Afraid that there's something that we could be missing
We'd pay any price to buy everything

For the sake of human nature
Sweet smell shotgun for the hip and blind

She strokes the gun - feel how it's warm
Got a mouthful dirt and razors
It'll cut right through last month's flavour
with a mouthful, wasted terrors
Kill your Darlings, Kill your Darlings

Cause I tried bein' helpful
Sayin' things I don't understand
Can't come up with no new lines
from their sweet surfaced mouths

She strokes the gun - feel how it's warm
Got a mouthful dirt and razors
It'll cut right through last month's flavour
with a mouthful, wasted terrors
Kill your Darlings, Kill your Darlings

Kiss the gun, bite the bullets
Get off the stick - get on
She can
Well I've seen all their faces
Shakin' hands full of napalm traces

She strokes the gun - feel how it's warm
Got a mouthful dirt and razors
It'll cut right through last month's flavour

DeGarmo & Key,Jericho  (Straight On Album Version),"What will you do when your walls come down?
You should have turned your heart
You should have turned it around

You thought you were safe
Behind your iron and clay walls
I told you long ago that you were due for a fall

Jericho,
You're gonna be the slave of the master's servants
Jericho,
Your cities are burning and the soldiers are coming for you

From cinders to ashes and they are all gone

To sing to me

The leaf that's following the sun
When will my weight be too much for you?
When will these ideas really be my own?
Cause this moment keeps on moving
We were never meant to hold on

This was a scene worth waking up for
When I woke up
You planted me in my own body
Don't know why
But somehow it just feels so wrong

When you said I will be lonely
But when you rise again I'll have become the sun
And I will shine down upon you
As if you were the only one

Your voice is your own, I can't protect it
You'll have to sing
A verse no one has ever known

Don't be afraid
Cause no one ever sings alone
Your weight will never be too much for me
Your ideas have always been your own

What you don't do
Just trying to protect yourself
And other fools like you
So well practised
In your deceit
Behind the high walls of stupidity
Your endless conceit
Behind the locked door
The sleeping dog you beat
I hope I see the day
She satisfies her teeth

Give back to the native
Their treaty land
What you preach you preach for others
Why don't you practice that firsthand

I just don't understand
This world of mine
I must be out of touch
Or out of my mind
And will the profits of destruction
Forever make your eyes blind
Do you bow to the corporations
'Cause they pay their bills on time

To the break of dawn, another dumb move
Ha, ha, ha this time it's over boy
This is me and you, head to head, let's go

Here we go, beat down round 2
Heads up punk 'cause it all comes down to
Me and you, face to face, head to head
Mic to mic, I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn, beats nitro
Lyrics weak, say goodnight 'cho
Star Trek shades, man cut the joke
Let's get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pitbull

Here's some mouthwash, g
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap, C-

Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son, I need jock relief
Here's a toothpick, now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it, yea, finish, burp
Now let a real man go to work
'Cause I'm a whip you like your daddy, beat ya like a baby
Sick ya like a dog, dropping lyrics wit rabies
Cut ya like a knife 'cause you're nuthin but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
I'm a treat ya like a hooker punk, change your clothes
Put you on the streets wit ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
You're trying to come off and don't know how to come
You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you wit a death blow

(Chorus)
Kill 'em kill 'em
I'll hit ya wit a death blow

My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma
'Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain is fatigued, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart 'cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears, or violins
Get your black suits 'cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
'Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit
A rhyme silencer, I hit 'em wit a death blow

If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marly marl can't save you from fallin
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lafidasical, lispless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local
Now LL's a laughing stock
'Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, whos' your daddy

Right before the office closes
Just to make my girlfriends green with envy
Ever since I lost you
All the crazy things I do
I didn't even know I had it in me.. Oh but

Hey it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody.. got no nothin to lose
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Spread a little misery round
Anything's better than feelin the blues

Found a restaurant on my way
Told 'em it was my birthday
Just to hear the waiters sing off-key
I've sprung a loose wire.. that's a fact
Got a strange little monkey on my back
But I kinda like the company.. and I guess

Hey, it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody.. got no nothin to lose.
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Dance the little monkey around

I thought was so real was thrown away and will be remembered among unpaling hatred.

Consider my suffering. 
Through all your pain. 
Remember my face. 
I'm digging your grave.

turning into something so wrong.

Cheapened and exploited.

And the valleys low
And already I'm weary
But I have so far to go
Oh, and sorrow holds my hand
And suff'ring sings me songs
But when I close my eyes
I know to Whom I belong
Who makes me strong

I will be free
I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free
Free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back
'Cause He awaits for me
Oh, I will be free

A wise man, a rich man
In paupers' clothes
A shepherd to lead us
Through the land of woes
Though many battles I have lost
So many rivers yet to cross
But when my eyes behold the Son
Who bore my loss, Who paid the cost
	
Oh, I will be free
I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free
Oh, free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back
'Cause He awaits for me
Oh, I will be free

Oh, oh, and I'll dance on silver moonlight
And I'll walk through velvet fields
Oh, and I'll run into the arms
The arms that set me free

Oh, I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free
Free to drink from the living fountain

Fairweather companions have left you all alone
This world full of changes has cut to the heart of your soul
But through all the pain only Jesus remains
And in each situation you know

He never changes, He's always the same
Through all the ages, He always remains
Forever constant, forever a friend
Forever faithful, His love knows no end
He never changes, He's always the same

A God so amazing I can't comprehend
The depth of His mercies such grace that has no end
I'm awed by the thought that I'm formed in the image of Him
But my humanity brings me down to my knees
And I find that's when His strength begins

As surely as the summer breezes come and go
There'a cold and lonely winter wind that's bound to blow
But through the turning of the seasons
You will never be alone",happy,1

Honey, tell me what it brings to mind
It's a picture of that '57 Chevrolet
I wish that we could ride it one more time

I still get excited when I think about
The drive-in picture shows you took me to
But I don't recall a lot about the movie stars
Mostly that old Chevrolet and you

They don't make cars like they used to
I wish we still had it today
The love we first tasted, the good love we're still living
We owe it to that old '57 Chevrolet

Remember when we used to park it in the lane
And listen to the country radio
We'd hold on to each other while the singer sang
And we'd stay like that 'til it was time to go

Now it makes me sad to think the good old days are gone
Although our love is still as strong today
But the world would have a lot more lovers hanging on
If they still made '57 Chevrolets

They don't make cars like they used to
I wish we still had it today
The love we first tasted, the good love we're still living

Thrice,All That's Left,"One day the dreamers died within us
When all our answers never came
We hid the truth beneath our skin but
Our shadows never looked the same

A ghost is all that's left 
Of everything we swore we never would forget
We tried to bleed the sickness, but we drained our hearts instead
We are, we are the dead

And when we couldn't stop the bleeding
We held our hearts over the flame
We couldn't help but call it treason
After that we couldn't fill our frames
After that our shadows never looked the same

A ghost is all that's left
Of everything we swore we never would forget
We tried to bleed the sickness, but we drained our hearts instead
We are, we are the dead

In summers past we'd challenge fate
With higher pitch and perfect aim 
And standing fast, we'd radiate
A light we loved but never named
But the answers never came 
Our shadows never looked the same

A ghost is all that's left (We are the ones who lost our faith)
Of everything we swore we never would forget (Can we be saved?)
We tried to bleed the sickness, but we drained our hearts instead
We are, we are the dead (We are the ones who lost our faith)
A ghost of everything we thought but never said (Can we be saved?)

And caused the land to sleep

At the age of twenty-two

To a tiny church in Liege
Where she sprang up from the coffin
Just after the Agnus Dei

She soared up to the rafters
Perched on a beam up there
Cried ""The stink of human sin
Is more that I can bear""

Christina the Astonishing
Was the most astonishing of all
She prayed balanced on a hurdle
Or curled up into a ball

She fled to remote places
Climbed towers and trees and walls
To escape the stench of human corruption
Into an oven she did crawl

O Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in a terrifying way
She would run wildly through the streets
Jump in the Meusse and swim away

Let your hips do the talkin', and pretend you don't know how.
Ruby red, oh baby blue,
Heaven knows what I can for you,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Stiletto heels in stockin's, trace the seam up to the top.
And you're daring me to touch you, but I won't know where to stop.
A little rude, that's what you say,
It must be hard to keep the wolves at bay,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Zig-zag, well it's my kinda move,
Big drag if I can't cut the groove,
No stone gonna be unturned,
When you're walkin', walkin' and a-talkin',
Baby, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.
Uh, doin' that walk.

The way we love ain't lovin', don't do nothin' for my heart.
Just a physical attraction, you're the bulls-eye - I'm the dart.
At least I know the way you feel,
Don't care nothing for a love that's real,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

And it's yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

I was at home late one night
The Lord asked me would I do His will
I told Him yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

I'm presenting my body, a living sacrifice
All I'm gonna do is the will of Christ
I was asked this question and the answer is yes

The question is when will Jesus return?
I want you to know soon, soon
Soon, soon, soon, soon

Look at the crisis in Iran
Russia's already invaded Afghanistan
Soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon

Oh, but I can hardly wait for Jesus to return
For His returning my heart of yearn
I was asked this question and the answer is real soon

Now the questions are will I ever leave You
Will I do Your will and when will Jesus return?
No and yes and soon, soon, soon, soon

Will I ever leave You, will I do Your will
When will Jesus return
And the answer is no and yes and soon, soon, soon, soon

Oh, if you've questioned when Christ is coming
The answer is soon",sad,0
Toni Braxton,Best Friend,"Oh, I remember on the 4th of July
That's when I learned it was true
The stories of taboo
How could you do it if your love was true
And still want to be in my life
And make no sacrifice
Now you come and tell me
That you're really sorry
And ask to be in my life again

Oh no there's no way to begin
Or start love over
Oh no lovemaking will there be here tonight
Oh don't you sigh
Or come cryin' on my shoulder
Should've thought about the consequences then
You and my best friend

Oh I recall the pain it hurt so bad
I didn't have the strenght to live
But I was just too young to die
See I have had my heart broken before
But never like this
I admit it baby left me feeling scorned
Now the love inside my heart is fading
The trust of my man and my best friend betrayed

Oh no there's no way to begin
Or start love over
Oh no lovemaking will there be here tonight
Oh don't you sigh
Or come cryin' on my shoulder
Should've thought about the consequences then

How could you do that to me
And tell me that our love would always be
Always be

Illustrious, succubus, do not trust

She know you wanna bust
Now she got you sippin on the clitorus, juice
Some of them juices is poisonous, juice
Shoulda took notes, when the master spoke
Places in the pussy, you can provoke
You got what you want

Simply Red,So Not Over You (Motivo-Pop Lectro Mix),"Don't know why I still slept on my side of the bed,
The emptiness when you were gone
Kept ringing in my head, 
Told myself I really had to move along,
Stop regretting all the things I left unsaid.

So I tore up your letters,
Took your picture off the wall.
I deleted your number,
It was too hard not to call.
And then I told myself that I would be fine
Gotta live for the good times.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over,
But I'm so not over you.

All my friends tried to tell me
That I'd find somebody new.
Why waste time being lonely,
When there's nothing left to loose.
Anything to get you out of my mind.
I'm a fool if I thought I could forget,
And I could not forget.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over.
But I'm so not over you.

Now I found a way to keep you there beside me,
To where my love for you cannot be denied.
I can only hope to keep you there to guide me,
There's no more need to hide from all this pain inside.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you.
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over.

You need someone to hold you tight 
Sometimes love don't know wrong from right 
Another long and senseless 
Fight was all you knew they're all the same 
There's no one left to take the blame 
What's behind this masquerade 
How do we win these losin' 
Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds we know they run so deep 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 

Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- how much pain does it take 

It's getting sometimes I don't know 
When to stop when to go 
Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show 
A stolen kiss so out of place 
It wipes the smile right off your face 
And when those feelings start 
We let them go, let them go 

Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds that run so deep 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 

Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- so tell me babe, how much pain 
Can you take before your heart breaks? 

I got this timebomb ticking in my head 
This time I think she's gonna blow 
How can I say get away 
When I just can't let go 

Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds that run so...

As the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

System of a Down,War?,"Dark is the light
The man you fight
With all your prayers, incantations
Running away, a trivial day
Of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold, this bounty soul
A gentile or a priest?
Who victored over, the Seljuks
When the Holy Land was taken

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

Was it the riches of the land
Powers of bright darkness
That lead the noble to the East
To fight the heathens

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it!

Now international security
The call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill man
History teaches us so
The reason he must attain
Must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war

Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens",sad,0

go to bed, turn out the fucking light

Should I try and forget?

Or, should I try and make it last?

to try and make me feel like I'm the one.

Winds Of Plague,Origins And Endings,"It begins when the time comes in 
And brings forth a dead current
A motion set for certain demise

We watched them come from the depths 
But we couldn't see it till we looked in their eyes
Behind the mask, the demon resides
The meat was stripped from their bones

We destroy!

Burn it all down
Put them back underground 
This is a day that I promise
You will not forget

With the heart of a warrior, 
I rise with all I have left

I watched as the walls crumbled backed 
Backed with a burning sky, legions fell
They left with a mission complete
Genocide fulfilled; leave me for dead

Miscreation of revenge beats through my veins
Empires that once rivaled us fell from the sky
Beg for life as you return to the Earth

The world will bow to me",sad,0

I need to feel your heartbeat to know our love's still alive
The power of your tender touch, you know I've waited long, long enough 
For just

One night alone - 
that's how it should be, all we need is
One night alone - just you and me
One night alone - you lovin' me, 
can't you give me
One night, one night

This isn't the way two lovers live
This isn't the dream I wanna be living in, no no no!



I'm tired of this telephone, can't you give me one night alone

One night alone - 
just you and me, all we need is
One night alone - 
that's how it should be
One night alone - you lovin' me, 
all we need is
One night, one night alone",happy,1

Leviticus-o...
Deuteronomy...

Snatch a piece of my wonderin'
Distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like
Seat of my boot like
Fly in my soup like
Where's the waitress?
Can't take this, really can't finish this
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake, i make it
J-dub to the boom now make it
Bounce-wiggle bounce-wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats
Bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain
This ain't no game
I'll show no shame
I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted cain
I'll twist again
I'll push the blade
As plain as day
Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
We shoot where who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear
We happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach
The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth ovah
Return of the 'Oh God'!

Chorus

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come on save the night
'Cause I don't believe
When the morning comes, it doesn't 
Seem to say an awful lot to me

if it rains we'll find somewhere, somewhere dry and warm

You'll say 'my, it's been a long, long time'
I'll say 'how are you? I've been fine'

Please come out tonight, let's go out and see the world
we can try to find, find somewhere
it seems so long ago, I can hardly remember the time
it's all I want, it's all I want, so let's see what we find

You'll say 'there's so much you need to know'
I'll say 'are you really sure you have to go?'

We don't need a reason, no explainations
just stay with me here, tonight
I won't say a word
I just need you here

Please come out tonight, let's go out and find ourselves
you can lean your head on my shoulder, remember?

You'll say 'My, is that the time?'
I'll say 'why not stay with me tonight?'

We don't need a reason

there's no one between us
if someone comes we can hide
just lay here beside me
just see what it's like

Warrant,Bed Of Roses,"On a dead end street
In a dead end town
There's a motel that I call home
Just a few small hopes
And a few small dreams
Is all that place is resting on

Desiree lives two doors down
She's been there for way too long
Oh Yeah!
Sometimes when she's feelin' down
you know I hope she hears this song

On a bed of roses
Not beneath some motel light
On a bed of roses
She deserves to sleep tonight
She deserves to sleep tonight

She comes home late everynight
I can hear her walkin' down my hall
She don't talk on the phone too much
When she does I hear it through my wall

Desiree don't have many friends
At least not many good ones
I may be just an ordinary man
But at least I'm someone to lean on

On a bed of roses
Not beneath some motel light
On a bed of roses
She deserves to sleep tonight
She deserves to sleep tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

On a bed of roses

In other rooms with other boys

And break up that fallow ground

To turn your whole life around
Let him in your heart
The choice is yours you don't have to be ashamed

Well you got a hot date and you wanna be fly 
Throw on a Gucci blazer and a Gucci tie 
Not a hair out of place,a freshly-shaved face 
You think you're walkin' out the house with style and grace 
(Don't you) 
You pick up your girl and take her to dinner 
'Cause when the night is over you think you're gonna win her 
Then you move real close using all your charm 
And then your girl says ""Baby guess that"" 

(I smell your underarms) 

That odor,it's ringin' out loud and clear as a bell 
You can't hear it because you're immune to the smell 
I describe your aroma as foul and pathetic 
And they can use your odor as the latest anesthetic 
Now I know that it's stone cold funk,I can tell 
'Cause it's written all over by the way you smell 
That funk the aroma,that smell,that scent 
You'll be arrested for malicious body odor intent 
Your odor going 'round,doin' people bodily harm 
And then somebody turned around and  said 

(I smell your underarms) 

You woke up late for work usin' the same old line 
Don't think I'm gonna wash my underarms this time 
The more you ignore,the worse the smell grows 
And you pick out all clothes by using your nose 
It was the rush hour when I was on the train 
And the smell of underarms was drivin' me insane 
It was a sure-fire way of bringing me to my death 
I couldn't hold a conversation,I was holding my breath 
And you cold see the funk just like a cloud in the air 
Was homeboy sittin' next to me,I swear! 
And when I saw the direction this girl was leaning 
You could hear homebody's underarms just screaming 
(ugh.....) 

(I smell your underarms) 

Hanging at a party one night,all alone 
Sippin' on a bottle of Dom Perignon 
The crowd was on the floor,rocking the beat 
Smelling like thay ain't bathed since last week 
The smell was all through the house,cold rockin' the place 
The funk fill the air like a fresh can of Mace 
When you raised your hands I had to sound tha alarm 
A girl said ""Look,there's Monster growin under his arm"" 
We were so shocked we couldn't even run (uhgh) 
And they declared  his arm public enemy number one 
Now throw your hands in the air,if you want to party hard 
Now put your hands back down,everybody's,'cause 
You didn't use Right Guard

EPMD,For My People,"Hereeeeeee we go....

Verse One: Erick Sermon

The E-R-I-C-K S-E-R-M-O-N
I'm dark skinned, pack a mac 10
More menace and I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash (yes) you ain't seen *shit* yet
Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety, for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately
I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin
You should hope, that disco appearance like broke
Mass destruction when I start crushin and bustin
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shit's thick
I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by USA and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people

Verse Two: PMD

Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin necks, bustin caps, and breakin jaws
It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
to whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in wrong camp, punk, stepped on a landmine
Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brentwood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some *bullshit* charge, mugshot on file
For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a tech nine
Yes the brother's back wit no knife or ax
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack
Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene
That's James Bond, 007, wit guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team
Don't bug or miss, bug on the sequel
For this *shit* I kick, it's strictly for my people

Janet Jackson,Again (Instrumental),"I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you again",sad,0
Ben Jelen,Come On (Sessions@AOL Version),"And finally the silence,
looking out 
looking back across the sky,
Trying to find a meaning,
knowing that I just left it all behind
Still I smell a lingering softness
Where did she go, 
how did she go, 
I wanna 
I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming 
here to me

Come on, 
without you 
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on

Thinking back before her,
I never knew the meaning of alone
Still the flag is feeling foreign,
I live the day to escape into a phone
Speaking of a world not real then
where did she go 
how did she go, 
I wanna 
I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming 
here to me

Come on, 
without you 
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on

Cause each of her kisses and my heart misses . . .
She's coming, 
She's coming here to me, 
I'm needing,
desiring to kiss her now, 
I'm living for her,
breathing for her, 
singing for her fairytale.

Come on, 
without you 
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on

Come on, 
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on",sad,0

Roger Creager,All For The Sake Of The Song,"Clay Blaker/Tommy Connors

Her name was Stella
And she was old and gray
She had her rusty strings and keys
And the tuner, it took a pair of pliers 
And lots of elbow grease
She awakened me to the melody 
Like the light from a brand new dawn
And from that moment on
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name was Maggie
She had eyes like fire
That burned for me in the dark
And all she wanted was my very soul 
And all she could take from my heart
But to her dismay a choice was made
And when the deed was done
She turned and I was gone
It was all for the sake of the song

And for the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name was Laura
She was pure like crystal
Shining alone on the shelf
And from the moment that her eyes met mine
I knew there could be nobody else
Kindred souls singing free in perfect harmony
Two hearts now beat as one
The road goes on and on
And it's all for the sake of the song

For the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song

Phil Collins,Everyday,"I got lost, couldn't find my way

Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
why I love everything about you

I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by (everyday...)

You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still

Life In Your Way,When Rules Change,"To the author of this dream
I can't say I know all the answers
I'm short on so many things
But I know the choices we make will make us who we are
Can we be brave again?
To put a foot down for what's right?
These things we strive to have will fall to the worth of the dirt we walk on
More or less a chasing after the wind
A kind of ignorance the bright despise
Leaving their face without a disguise
Let them know that this is the last time
Let them know they put themselves to shame
Let them know
There is a movement, a movement in the air
Can you feel it?
Could we be brave again and not step aside?
If I had to, would I stand alone?",happy,1

FFH,Listen,"Voices are everywhere, and they're screaming at us: use me, buy me, believe me.  We've got voices all over our culture: chat rooms, commercials, billboards, and bumper stickers, and they all want our immediate attention.

And then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times.  You can't do it.  You can't do it on your own.  You're not smart enough.  You're not strong enough.  You're not stable enough.  You're not thin enough.  And then there's the enemy.  The father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way you'll ever make anything of yourself.

I had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago.  He's a great man.  I love him so much.  And he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him.  My dad had just put a room onto his house.  And my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dad's work.  And he got done and went to my dad, and said, ""That's a good job Harry.""  And that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad, and he was 38 years old.

Man, and without hearing that voice.  Without hearing that, whether it's the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother, or the voice from God, you don't have any identity.  You have no way to function.  I think Jesus knew that.  I think that's why, when He went through His ministry, touching people and healing people, and speaking to people.  He never asked them to be anything that they weren't.  He tried to get them to understand who they were.  That's why he said, ""You're my daughter, you're my son, you're my brother, you're my sheep.""  He wanted us to identify with Him and understand that we're His creation; that we're worth something.



Yeah, and that's something amazing about Jesus.  He could look down into somebody's spirit and draw out who they really were.  I mean, he looked at Simon and said, ""You know what?  You're not Simon, You're Peter.  You're a Rock.""

And how 'bout that woman that came up to Him when He was going through that crowd, and she touched His garment, and he turned around and he said, ""Daughter.""  His first word: Daughter. 

You know, Jesus got that honestly from His father.  Three times when Jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry, God the father actually spoke.  I mean, spoke audibly, It wasn't inward.  Jesus heard it, and the people around Jesus heard it.  Like at His baptism, God the father said, ""you are my son, I love you and I'm pleased with you.""  And then at the transfiguration, the father spoke again and the disciples heard it.  The father said, ""You are my son.  I have chosen you, and God just established Christ's purpose on that mountain.""  And then, before Christ died at Gethsemane in John 12, Jesus prayed: should I pray to be delivered from this hour?  No.  This is why I've come.  Glorify your name father.  And the father spoke and said, ""I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.""  And I think that promise just drove Christ to the cross.  

I think it did too.  You may have never heard that voice.  That voice that says you're worth it.  You're smart enough.  I believe in you.  I love you.  There may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into, and it's just a vacuum.  Listen, Jesus doesn't require anything of you.  You can't work to get His approval.  Remember, when he was affirmed by His father, when God looked down and said, ""This is my son who I love.""  Jesus hadn't done a single miracle.  All he asks of you is that you listen.",sad,0

In the city air, in all our seas
You can see every other colour bleed into
Yellow Brown

There is no time to spend
Concerned that this is just a trend
To lay the blame everywhere
When it's yours that is the lion's share of
Yellow Brown

And I won't do
'Cos you won't do
'Cos we know there's nothing they will do about
Yellow Brown

There's nothing to save us from ourselves
But the world keeps turning
The world keeps turning",sad,0

Foghat,Dead End Street,"Dave Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP

Well, I was raised on a back street,
Time's were tough, but kind of bittersweet.
Left school when I was still a child,
Hit the streets and started running wild.
Hanging out in the neighborhood,
People said, ""They're up to no good!""
Never thought I'd ever make it through,
Hey boy, what you gonna do?

Crosstown traffic, sirens wailing, screaming in my ear.
It's got me on the run, gotta move on out of here.

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me,
From this dead end street, oh yeah.

They still talk about the big fight,
On the backstreet at midnight.
Everybody heard the gunfire,
Saw him dragged into the Black Maria.
Now my best friend is doing time,
He's committed to a life of crime.
Got a feeling I'll be next in line,
I wonder how can I get out in time?

I stepped into a movie, this can't be reality.
If I wasn't so lucky, I wonder where I'd be?

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me,
From this dead end street, oh yeah.

{Rod - Slide Solo}

Crosstown traffic, sirens wailing, screaming in my ear.
It's got me on the run, gotta move on outta here.

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
It's got me walking, it's got me talking,
I'm on a dead end street, I'm on a dead end street.
Yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah, whoo...",happy,1

George Harrison,All Things Must Pass (2009 Digital Remaster),"Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always going to be this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away

Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always going to be this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away

All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way
And face another day

Now the darkness only stays the night-time
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey

Talib Kweli,Everything Man (Album Version),"I don't, remember the first time I heard Kwe-li
I don't remember what I was doing
There were no remembered witnesses to my doings
But it seems like I've known him, forever
He who has, moved through mornings and midnights
Through, deaths and dawns
To document our bones our blood our lives
Listen, listen to his exact wings
Strumming mists from clouds
Listen, listen a man always punctual with his, mouth
Listen to his, revolution of syllables
Scoping lightning from his pores
Keeping time, with his hurricane beat
Asking us to pick ourselves up and become, THUNDER

Yeah, they say you can't please everybody...
Let's go! Yeah, ay, they ain't know what that sound like

Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat

Yo, what becomes of a dream deferred
that never makes it to the world to be seen or heard
Do it breathe? Do it got a heartbeat? Is it alive?
Do it leave, only to become a star in the sky?
I believe, no scratch that I know, this ain't my full potential
Only usin 10 percent of my mental on instrumentals
But incidentally my, energy heavenly
Can he be so ill there ain't no, pill or no remedy
The, maker of memories posess the recipe to your fate
Make no mistake there ain't no escapin your destiny
Especially when, 'til death do us part, like wedding rings
I'll be here forever, put that on e'rything

You're everything maaaaaaaaan!
You're everything maaaaaaaaan!


Your Alpha and your Omega, your beginning and your end
Your father, your brother, your lover your friend
The blood in your vein that gets spilled and, runs in the drain
That's right my flow one and the same, the joy and the pain
My name, the burner that destroy the toy and the train
All city all night I'm enjoyin the fame
I'm a hustler, I'm a gangster and a rebel with the rank of a general
In the battle between God or the Devil
I lay claim to your spirit, your religion, your belief system
I'll do your hit in your kitchen and you're relief pitchin
This kid proficient in, every position
The man of your dreams and your nightmares commandin your vision
'Til it's quite clear like light beer, yeah I'm standin right here
I get you hot but stay cooler than the night air
I try to fit it in the same rhyme
But realize, I can't be everything to everyone at the same time

You're everything maaaaaaaaan!
You're everything maaaaaaaaan!

Pass the Uzi, to blow up, any wack MC that show up, 
there goes one, blast 'im now.

*Don't make me wait-wait* because it might be too late, the punk might escape,
and buck whyle, and in fact, bite my style, and I'm-a catch a bullshit charge,
plus trial.
It's my thing to swing, your first mistake to bring a duck MC that can't hang.
Don't forget, I'm crazy swift. My name is Erick Sermon

When suckers tried to crash my shit straight from start.
A young black kid destined for success, no Old Gold, no cocaine, or buddha cess.
Straight up hard work. No sleep and no shorts.
Brainstormin' with the skills that Pop Duke taught.
To keep swingin', yeah, and not to quit.
Now I ride the Benz, you ride the dick, with your punk friends,
straight up pussy from Punk City, my attitude's fucked up and real shitty.
From the backstabbers, yeah my so-called friends,
who swim in my pool. When it's time, flex the Benz,
around town, windows down at the South Town, Cool J tape or K-Solo ""Spellbound""
With fly girlies dippin, brothers grippin' and sippin'
Old Gold, Red Bull, hands on my dick and
I'm just lampin' with my EK shades, truck-jewels, obviously the man's paid.
But of course not, brother can't get his props
like for instance, when I cruise up the block
in my 560 lampin' on my Metro phone, chrome kit beamin' all off your dome.
But like a sucka, yeah, you looked the other way
That's how I knew you're on my dick kid, but it's okay.
It's normal, relax, your whole head's busted.
Caught in the rap skit, ya couldn't be trusted.
Cuz my sounds pound from here to Okinowi...{kiss} peace and I'm ouuuutie!

Stay tuned to this last episode, when I rock the house and the mic explodes.
This is not the buckwild style that I be usin', in fact black,
it causes {mass confusion}
It's a fallout, when sucker MCs and crowds call out my name,
oh what a shame I got {fame!}

I'm not a new jack, my rhymes are not wack, and in fact,
I'm like Clint Eastwood, 'stead of bullets, rhymes I pack
in my flow gun, so son, ya better run,
cuz when it comes to hostage and prisoners, we take none.
We move wax like kilos ...{scratch}
and when my jam hits the streets, the sounds explode.
Watch the right hook, duck the death blow jack,

C'mon!

Homey it's hard not to kill niggas, it's like a full time job
Not to pull out the steel and shove it in your grill
Young California got that mass appeal
I summons the hood, they get up in yo' ass for real
Knockout flow, Winky Wright jab for real
And all you niggas pussy, need Massengil
See I'm the gun-cocker, one-shotter, lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down, like a cantaloupe, my flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so, motherfuckin' six-four
Your bitch know, hop in the back when you see Swizz hoe
This that, all you niggas get up off my dick so
I can cook crack on the track and watch it mix slow
Cocaine, my flow fire, call it propane
Every nigga know Game, five shots no pain
And that's the reason why I'm shittin' on you niggas
Shut me in the looney bin, I'm sicker than you niggas

This is that disrespectful, motherfuckin' West coast
Hip-hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go!

[The Game]
Where I'm from, I seen the most stand up niggaz lay down
Where skinny niggas make buff niggas victims of that trey-pound
And gang-bangers is the sharpshooters, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his ass down and take the money out his tube socks
West coast niggas is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas, make money with the smartest niggas
I ain't got time for you fuckin' artist niggas
Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the motherfuckin' sergeant nigga
Beauty pageant-ass niggas on the runway
(Boyz N The Hood) till they see the nigga in that red Hyundai
Blow his fuckin' back out, cause I'm the rap Stack-house
Black Wall Street bitch, the hip-hop crack-house, what?

[Chorus: x2]

[The Game]
My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly
Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the shit cancer
One man show cause I fucked all the dancers
Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These niggas let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean, mean, rappin' machine
Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary
I'm runnin' the buildin', don't make me run in the buildin'
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin'
Walkin' past offices I see my son in the buildin'
Last album on the wall I'm number one in the buildin'
They should build me an office up under the buildin'
My elevator goin' down, I am done in the buildin' nigga

Drinking my own blood
And a voice, it whispers, ""Hello my love""

Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to

Tainted sheets pulled right over my head
I'm singing all our favorite songs out loud
And I'm hoping you can hear them somehow

You've packed up the cups and dishes
Loaded down the car
Hold your horses just a minute
Before you get too far

Where you think you're goin' with my heart

You can have the 'frigerator and the new TV
Take the pictures off the wall
That's alright by me but
Where you think you're goin' sweet pea
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Girl, we had a good thing goin'
Now you're gonna leave
But you've got somethin' that belongs to me
Look at me now, can't you see
It's tearin' me apart
Where you think you're goin' sugar puddin'
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

If that's what you want
Is for me to just break right down
I just might do it

Girl, we had a good thing goin'
But now you're gonna leave
But you've got somethin' that belongs to me
Look at me now, can't you see
It's tearin' me apart
Where you think you're goin' honey bunny
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Where you think you're goin' sweet cheeks
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Come back here with that
You can't take everything
Don't you want to kiss me
Just for the good times
It's goin' be sad and lonesome here 
Without you",sad,0
Sandi Thom,When Horsepower Meant What It Said,"Caught in the gridlock nose to tail across all lanes
Smog nearly chocking me as the car horns go insane
Patiently waiting to get their old jobs backs
Carrying the human race proudly on their backs

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

I've got a hundred horses hidden in between my wheels
But i can't put my foot down and jumped the fences in the field
Patiently waiting to get their old jobs back

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

And if we're keeping up with progress why am i standing still
Maybe we should take a walk and talk to the horses on the hill

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said",happy,1

The Ronettes,(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up,"Baby when we break up from a quarrel or a fight
I can't wait to have you back and hold you, oh, so tight
Tell me why, I wanna know, tell me why, is it so
That the best part of breaking up is when you're making up
Best part of breaking up is when you're making up
But after breaking up be sure you're making up with me

Well it makes no difference who was wrong
Just as long as I'll be with you

Baby I'll be lonely till you're back where you should be

Charlotte Gainsbourg,IRM,"If I had my way
I'd cross the desert to the sea
Learn to speak in tongues something
That makes sense to you and me

I'd like to unplug the phone
Sending messages with a mirror
Stand on the old plateau
With a satellite dish and Geronimo's ghost

Down in the Rio Del Sol
I sunk my suitcase alone
Filed up the Amazon
With snakes and vines and ropes for my clothes

Me And Jane Doe and Rousseau
We've got nowhere to go
Walking through cactus and stones

Down in the city so cold
Shining like razors in the sun
You can go there anytime that you like
And try to find happiness from a gun",sad,0

Asleep At The Wheel,The Letter That Johnny Walker Read,"Johnny Walker sat at a table at the bar, minding his own affairs
drinking his namesake over rocks, drunk, too drunk to care
when a girl in the bar walked up beside, and this is what she said
she said a woman came by with a letter for you and this is what the letter said

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
and John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said 
the letter that Johnny Walker read

then John, he got up from the table, slowly he walked outside
he was thinking of his wife and little children back home
how his drinking had ruined their lives
then John, he stared off into that streetlight
and the vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
for it was him, lying drunk in that gutter
clutching in his hand the letter that Johnny Walker read

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
and John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibrate does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,

Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)

Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like ""Pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
And moon river what'd you do to me?

I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands

I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise
Of revelation, set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around

And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
Your mind is poisoned

Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
A drawbridge is closin'

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide

Out where the dreams are high
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow

Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring

Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you?

Or did you leave it back in '61?

Now I'm not one to second guess
What angels have to say
But this is such a strange way to save the
World

To think of how it could have been
If Jesus had come as He deserved
There would have been no Bethlehem
No lowly shepherds at His birth

CHANNEL
But Joseph knew the
Reason love had to reach so far
And as he held the Savior in his arms
He must have thought

REPEAT CHORUS

Now, I'm not one to second guess
What angels have to say
But this is such a strange
Way to save the world
Such a strange way, this is
Such a strange way
A strange way to save the world
A strange way to save the world",happy,1
Alias,Standing In The Darkness,"Ten times before it divided you
Ten years ago to this very day
Hello, I wish you well
There's no response, no companions here
Can't read the signs or between the lines
Goodbye, I wish you well

Now where are we going
I don't know and I don't even care

I'm running through the night
Searching in the shadows
Looking for the light
Running through the night
Searching in the shadows
Going for the light
Standing in the darkness
Its all a glow I cant see the stars
Fourth of July in the summertime
And now its time to sail
Caught in the act now you watch my back
Can't tell a lie I'm afraid to die
Goodbye I wish you well
Now where are we going

Help me break this spell that I'm under
Guide my feet and hold me tight

It's time to face my weakness
Look him in the eye
Lord knows it wont be easy
but I've just gotta try
I cant let myself get lost in his arms

Joy Division,Leaders Of Men,"Born from some mother's womb
Just like any other room
Made a promise for a new life
Made a victim out of your life

When your time's on the door
And it drips to the floor
And you feel you can touch
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown
Are no longer your own

Just a minor operation
To force a final ultimatum
Thousand words are spoken loud
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd

When you walk down the street
And the sound's not so sweet
And you wish you could hide
Maybe go for a ride
To some peep show arcade
Where the future's not made

A nightmare situation
Infiltrate imagination
Smacks of past Holy wars
By the wall with broken laws

The leaders of men
Born out of your frustration
The leaders of men
Just a strange infatuation
The leaders of men
Made a promise for a new life
No saviour for our sakes
To twist the internees of hate
Self induced manipulation
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation",sad,0
Seventh Day Slumber,Shattered Life,"This wanting more from me is tearing me, it's breaking me
But what you want's not mine to give
I'm your dollar sign, your brand new house,
Your product line
When you're done with me I'm spent.
When the smoke is gone I have to face what I've become...

Chorus:
Will you rescue me? Could you get me out alive?
I'm trying to hold on but I've lost the will to fight
Will You rescue me? Take me far away from this shattered life.

How can I go on pretending that there's nothing wrong?
Life has brought me to my knees
This mask I hide behind is killing me,
There's nothing left
Is there anyone who feels like me?
When the smoke is gone I have to face what I've become...

And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet, I'm running to her like a river strong

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Takes my troubles away, takes away my grief
Takes away my heartache, in the night like a thief

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Yes I need, yes I need her in the daytime
And oh I need, yes I need her in the night
I want to throw my arms all around her
To kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight
And oh...

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me sweet sweet lovin', brighten up my day
It makes me righteous and it makes me whole
Makes me mellow, down into my soul

She gives me love, love, love, crazy love
One more time, she gives love, just a little love

But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well whaddya know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move fakin
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, Nyquil will help you get your Z's troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin, I've had it up to here
My days of payin dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (YEAH)
Head for the border, go get a taco
I'll be wreckin from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

East coast stompin, rippin and rompin
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton

And wow how now wow how now Brown cow

Scores for the snores that's lovin dance floors

It's the leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here!)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear!)

Heel up, reel up, bring it back, come rewind

I'm dark skinned, pack a mac 10
More menace and I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash (yes) you ain't seen *shit* yet
Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety, for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately
I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin
You should hope, that disco appearance like broke
Mass destruction when I start crushin and bustin
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shit's thick
I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by USA and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people

Verse Two: PMD

Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin necks, bustin caps, and breakin jaws
It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
to whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in wrong camp, punk, stepped on a landmine
Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brentwood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some *bullshit* charge, mugshot on file
For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a tech nine
Yes the brother's back wit no knife or ax
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack
Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene
That's James Bond, 007, wit guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team
Don't bug or miss, bug on the sequel
For this *shit* I kick, it's strictly for my people

Animals move animals reputed
Every daily grades let it be the reason

In Eden leading seeping
And I don't wanna rock the pump

Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit

Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts

Wid the nines and beams the philly and green
Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me

Eyes bloodshot red when I floss instead
I rather run up and smash you wid a passion
And they chalking it off his head

The Red Hot Chili Peppers,Fight Like A Brave,"Hide behind your rocks
Put down your gloves
I'm not here to box
This is no showdown
So throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter
Where you come from
You could be from Park Ave
Or from a park bench
You could be a politician
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave
I'm talkin' bout that freedom
Fight like a brave

Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

If you're sick-a-sick 'n' tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission

Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
'Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme

Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

Wyclef Jean,Guantanamera,"Hola!  Soy Celia Cruz
Y estoy aqui con Wyclef, celebrando Carnival; Azucar!!)
(singing)	Guantanamera
(Wyclef)	We out here in Miami just shining
(singing)	Guajira, Guantanamera
(Wyclef)	Worldwide
(singing)	Guan-tana-mera
(Wyclef)	Bout to bring it to you in stereo
(singing)	Guajira voy, de na meda
		Yo soy un hombre sincero
(Wyclef)	That was then, this is now
		Welcome to the Carnival, the arrival... c'mon!
(singing)	De donde crecen las palmas

(Wyclef Jean)
Spanish Harlem!	Oahh-eee-ohh!
Boogie Down Bronx!	Oahh-eee-ohh!
Manhattan!	 Oahh-eee-ohh!
Back to Staten! Oahh-eee-ohh!

Guantanamera
	Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajira, Guantanamera
	Hey, yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajira Guan-tana-mera...

Verse One: Wyclef Jean

Yo, I wrote this in Haiti, overlooking Cuba
I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'
Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl, to a grown woman
Like a Virgin, so she sex with no average mahn
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide
Pac Woman better yet Space Invader
If your name was Chun-Li, we'd be playin Street Fighter
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Chorus:

Guantanamera
	Hey yo, I'm standin at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajira, Guantanamera
	Yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajira Guan-tana-mera...

(singing in Spanish, with Wyclef responses)
Soy una mujer, sincera
Do you speak English?
De donde crecen las palmas
Can I buy you a drink?
Soy una mujer, sincera
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
De donde creeeeeeecen las palmas
You killin me
Y antes de morir, yo quiero
..
cantar mis versos del alma
Te quiero mama, te quiero!!

Guantanamera
	Aiyyo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajira, Guantanamera
	Hey yo John Forte, she's eyeing me from far
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajira Guan-tana-mera

Verse Two: Lauryn Hill

Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamacita beg your pardon
Make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates
Pure traits of genius, Goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggaz angry cause they can't get between us
to no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo
and then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera

You are the river 
Pour out of this life

You are the morning bird

And the silence won't cease

Cut your teeth and now it's time to show the world that what your made of
Was a travesty that many just call luck

Blue Rodeo,Mystic River,"I can't believe it's true I finally got you here 
I been waiting for this moment for some years 
I've been torn down enough to know 
Everyone goes through this door 
Just before their lives explode 
Come in here with a heavy load

Walking down the road watching the day begin 
Radio song is playing off in a distant wind 
But you can feel it its a gentle love 
Coming out soft from the windows above 
Just when you have had enough 
Here comes the world you've been dreaming of 

Oh my my the Mystic River 
She takes your heart 
And you will forgive her 
Lay me down beside the water 
I look across at the sons and daughters 

Sun comes up each day to chase away the moon 
Even the stars at night they fade away too soon 
You can't do much about the trouble life brings 
Cut all the lines so the phones don't ring 
But stay here once from spring to spring 
Watching the ice melt the mornings sing 

Oh my my the Mystic River 
She takes your heart 
And you will forgive her 
Lay me down beside the water 
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now 

There's a tree that grows out in the burning sands 
Never a drop of rain that nobody understands 
You can push me I don't mind 
Leave me out here and I'll be fine 
Cause everyone's gonna have their time 
Up or down honey you decide 

Oh my my the Mystic River 
She takes your heart 
And you will forgive her 
Lay me down beside the water 
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now",happy,1

In another world that spins around for fun

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary...""",happy,1

The Antlers,Stairs To the Attic,"I decided on that evening that I was through with sitting still
I stood up and started moving with a childlike fascination
For those doors that don't have locks and the stairways that were blocked
So I dug through the obstruction, put my fist around the railing

And each step was far apart and far away from steps before it
And the air was getting thinner 'til I couldn't breathe at all
And if I happened to look behind me there were miles and miles of stairs
Enough so I couldn't see the doorway but I knew that it was there

And on the last step I was dizzy 'cause there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door and through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes, without a ceiling, everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger and suddenly I saw that I was

Upstairs and outside and
Freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me
The answer, the feeling and the truth

That I'm small
That I'm small
That I'm small
I'm smaller than the smallest fireball",happy,1

I don't remember what I was doing
There were no remembered witnesses to my doings

He who has, moved through mornings and midnights
Through, deaths and dawns
To document our bones our blood our lives
Listen, listen to his exact wings
Strumming mists from clouds
Listen, listen a man always punctual with his, mouth
Listen to his, revolution of syllables
Scoping lightning from his pores
Keeping time, with his hurricane beat
Asking us to pick ourselves up and become, THUNDER

Yeah, they say you can't please everybody...
Let's go! Yeah, ay, they ain't know what that sound like

Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat

Yo, what becomes of a dream deferred
that never makes it to the world to be seen or heard
Do it breathe? Do it got a heartbeat? Is it alive?
Do it leave, only to become a star in the sky?
I believe, no scratch that I know, this ain't my full potential
Only usin 10 percent of my mental on instrumentals
But incidentally my, energy heavenly
Can he be so ill there ain't no, pill or no remedy

Your Alpha and your Omega, your beginning and your end
Your father, your brother, your lover your friend
The blood in your vein that gets spilled and, runs in the drain
That's right my flow one and the same, the joy and the pain
My name, the burner that destroy the toy and the train
All city all night I'm enjoyin the fame
I'm a hustler, I'm a gangster and a rebel with the rank of a general
In the battle between God or the Devil
I lay claim to your spirit, your religion, your belief system
I'll do your hit in your kitchen and you're relief pitchin
This kid proficient in, every position
The man of your dreams and your nightmares commandin your vision
'Til it's quite clear like light beer, yeah I'm standin right here

I try to fit it in the same rhyme
But realize, I can't be everything to everyone at the same time

The trouble that we're havin', does it mean there's someone new
Or am I just bothered by the thought of losing you
Will someone come and take you, will I lose you by and by
Like I lost you in my castle in the sky.

If we should ever part, the world for me would end
How could I tell my heart, I only lost a friend
Be faithful, don't forsake me, never leave and say goodbye
Like you left me in my castle in the sky.",happy,1

Now here you are ignorin' me
Girl I might as well be

I'll be stickin' out my thumb

You kissed me and held me tight
You said you'd always be my cowgirl
But tonight you're hangin' out
With that Christian Dior crowd
So where does that leave me now girl
You're as cold as Polar regions
I oughta join the French Foreign Legion And Go

I tried to kiss the judge from the electrica' chair
Yeah we're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

The guitar's cranked and the bass man's blown a fuse
And when the whole gang bangs tell me then what's you're excuse

We got the fever, fever, fever, fever

Fever gives ya lust with an appetite
It hits ya like the fangs from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

We can't run away from trouble
There ain't no place that far
But if we do it right at the speed of light
There's the back seat of my car, caviar

I was feelin' so high I forgot what day
Now I'm feelin' low down even slow seems way too fast
And now the booze don't work and the drugs ran out of gas

I got the fever, fever, fever, fever

The buzz that you be gettin' from the crack don't last
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass
Yeah we're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

My first time ever lover
We fell asleep out on the lawn
And when I woke up I was all alone
Makin' love to the crack of dawn
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir
The gangster of love rides again

I got the fever
You know I gotta chill
Fever
It gimme such a thrill
Fever
Like a burnin' plague
Fever
Yeah get outta my way

Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear
As long as I'm in heaven honey I don't care
You look so good baby look so fine
I tell you you're the image of the perfect crime
You gets so tired holdin' on so tight
If you think you're goin' crazy well you may be right
Yeah, we're all here 'cause we're not all there, that's right",sad,0
Phil Collins,Everyday,"I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry (everyday...)
Yes everyday I fall (everyday...)
Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try 
to make my heart be still
'til then every way there is to cry
ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by (everyday...)
And everyday I fall (everyday...)
It makes me wonder why (everyday...)
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'cos every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'til then every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

Robben Ford,I Got Over It (Album Version),"I got over it finally got around it
I got over it finally got around it
I got over it it's in my past at last

Well the day that I first met you
I thought you were the sweetest thing
But after a while you got so dog gone wild
Lord it was a crying shame

I got over it finally got around it
I got over it finally got around it
I got over it it's in my past at last

I was so in love and so true, honey
Then I found it all in vain
Everytime I would turn my back
You were hittin' on someone again

I got over it finally got around it
I got over it finally got around it
I got over it it's in my past at last

(bridge)
So high finally got over
So wide finally got around it.........
So deep finally came to the surface
I can't believe you did this all on purpose

I didn't want no angel
Or a man who could only jive
All I wanted was one man
To keep me satisfied

Tonight you told me that you ache for something new
And some other woman is lookin' like something

When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please baby, can't you see I'm trying to explain
I've been here before
And I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again

Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away
You'll wake up tomorrow
And wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today
